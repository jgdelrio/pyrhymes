"Salud!" lyrics

The Carters (Beyonce & Jay-Z) Lyrics




"Salud!"



[JAY-Z:]
Yeah, uh, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Uh, uh, uh

[Beyoncé & Dre:]
Put it on ice, celebrate that we made it
I put it on Christ (that's on God, yeah)
Lord knows it takes hella patience
When your name is a verb and these comments absurd
And they swear they know you better than you know yourself
Cause you control yourself, just me and you, salud!
Baby look me in my eye, take a cheers to you and I, cheers to you
Baby look me in my eye, make a cheers to you and I, salud!

[JAY-Z & Beyoncé:]
Mazel tov, gold bottle talk, wife got a model walk
(Wife got a model walk)
House all glass, slide the doors you ain't gotta walk (gotta walk)
And to top it off (top it off), got another one in Montauk
(Montauk, Montauk, Montauk)
Trifecta down in Tribeca (Tribeca, Tribeca), bonjour (bonjour)
French crib in the french quarters (yeah)
Champagne in the glass, toast to the importers (yeah)
Spill some out for the past

[Beyoncé & Dre:]
Put it on ice, celebrate that we made it
I put it on Christ (that's on God, yeah)
Lord knows it takes hella patience
When your name is a verb and these comments absurd
And they swear they know you better than you know yourself
Cause you control yourself, just me and you, salud!
Baby look me in my eye, take a cheers to you and I, cheers to you
Baby look me in my eye, take a cheers to you and I, salud!

[JAY-Z & Beyoncé:]
Hola (hola), thank the most high for the coca
Salud! (salud, salud, salud, salud)
God protect babies and fools, I was both (both)
It's not just a popular trope (both)
The wind comes and I'm just a flute (oh)
The winds come and I'm not a fluke (oh)
I'm convinced that I'm truly the GOAT (oh my God)
Sosa, the Elohim intervene like boy you the truth
Don't die (don't die, don't die)
Angels on both sides, toast with mimosas (both sides, both sides)
Your president tweeting about Hov like he knows us
My road to the top was to take what you owe us
I give a fuck what that man find vulgar
Just look in my eyes when you toast us

[Beyoncé & Dre:]
Put it on ice, celebrate that we made it
I put it on Christ (that's on God, yeah)
Lord knows it takes hella patience
When your name is a verb and these comments absurd
And they swear they know you better than you know yourself
Cause you control yourself, just me and you, salud!
Baby look me in my eye, take a cheers to you and I, cheers to you
Baby look me in my eye, take a cheers to you and I, salud!

[Beyoncé & Blue Ivy Carter:]
Mazel tov, put up your glass, put up your last, put up yo bag
Throw up a light, show that we bright, blow money fast
This for my kinfolk
Left out the window
Let them all know
This what we ball for, yo
Shout out to Rumi and Sir, love Blue
