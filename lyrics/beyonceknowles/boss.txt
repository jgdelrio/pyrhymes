"Boss" lyrics

The Carters (Beyonce & Jay-Z) Lyrics




"Boss"



[Beyonce:]
Ain't nothing to it
Real one
Ain't nothing to it
Boss
Ain't nothing to it
Real one
Ain't nothing to it
(There's nothing)
Boss

I pay the cost
Who gone take it off (take it off)
On the court than I ball (I ball)
I ignored a lot of calls (click, click)
You ain't talking about nothing
I ain't got no time
Got that dinero on my mind
I got real problems just like you (Bitch!)
Tell that bitch, I don't like you (I don't fuck with you)

Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, boss
Ain't nothing to it, real one
Ain't nothing to it, I boss
Ooh, real one
I'm a boss

[Jay-Z (Beyonce):]
Hundred million crib, three million watch, all facts
No cap, false nigga you not a boss, you got a boss
Niggas getting jerk, that shit hurts, I take it personally
Niggas rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they can pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin' to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbing what I gross (What I gross!)
Survey says you not even close (Not even close)
Everybody's bosses, to the time that pay for the office
To them invoices, separate the men from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody gets broke except for you
Boss!

[Beyonce:]
Ain't nothing to it
Real one
Ain't nothing to it
Boss
Ain't nothing to it
Real one
Ain't nothing to it
I boss
Ooh, real one
I'm a boss
Oh, yeah

Ain't nothing to it, I boss so I bought my momma a whip
My great, great, grandchildren already rich
That's a lot of brown children on your Forbes list
Probably looking around my compound on my fortress, boss
I be ridin' around with my seat reclining
Droppin' my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin' car doors
I be true balling on these bum whores
You ain't talking about nothing
I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them pets they gotta relax
Toes in the sand, momma gettin' fast

Ain't nothing to it
Real one
Ain't nothing to it
Boss
Ain't nothing to it
Real one
Ain't nothing to it
I boss
Ooh, real one
I'm a boss
Oh, yeah

Ooh, ooh, I'm a boss

"Boss" features additional vocals by Ty Dolla Sign and Blue Ivy Carter, Beyonc√© and Jay-Z's daughter.


"Hundred million crib" from the lyrics of this song is a reference to the latest purchase by The Carters, an $88 million compound in Bel-Air, Los Angeles.


By saying "three million watch" on this track, Jay-Z mentions his 2017 Patek Philippe "Grand Complications" timepiece that costed this much.


The line "Pride always goeth before the fall" is a reference to the Bible's Proverbs 16:18, "Pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall."
