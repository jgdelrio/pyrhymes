"Summer" lyrics

The Carters (Beyonce & Jay-Z) Lyrics




"Summer"



[Rory:]
Right now inside the place to be with the one JAY-Z and Bey
Slowing down the dance to a different type of speed
You know it's Cool & Dre deh pan the beat
You know, a bloodclaat heat
(Right)

[Beyoncé & JAY-Z:]
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To be in each other's arms, yeah
Let it breathe, let it breathe
I wanna drown in the depth of you
When the water's so blue (so blue, so blue)
So blue (so blue)
I need to take my time, oh yeah
Show you somethin' real (so real)
So real (let it breathe), so real (let it breathe, so real)
I want you to come inside right now
So you know just how I feel
How I feel (let it breathe, let it breathe), yeah

We never been this far from the shore
We might not ever go back anymore
Got you all in your emotions, hit you with the force then
Tell me your desires, I won't ever tire
You'd rather play the game than to throw the fight
Boy you know that ain't right
When I’m needing your affection, I need that attention
Up and down motion, come swim in my ocean, yeah yeah

Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To be in each other's arms
Let it breathe, let it breathe
I wanna drown in the depth of you, yeah yeah (yeah yeah)
Where the water's so blue
So blue (so blue)

I brought my sand to the beach
Hopped out the Lam' with the sheep
Skin rugs on the floor
We hugged, made love on the seats
We tried to hide in the hills
We watched the sky turn peach
Summer's light like, summer's night
It's like, Christ masterpiece
She taste like Corona Light, sweet
Even the lime gotta squeeze
She gave me a lil swig, to chase behind my weed
If I can stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me
I don't have no concept of time
Even with a rose gold Concept on me
I remember summer nights in the projects
Bullet rounds interrupting my Chi
When the worst thing that could happen
Zipped up his jacket and ran back down the street
In Bel-Air only the nights get cold
I wrapped a yellow jacket around Bey
It's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep

Oh, let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To be in each other's arms, yeah
Let it breathe, let it breathe
I need to take my time to show you somethin' real (so real)
This is real (so real)
I want you to come inside right now
So you know just how I feel, how I feel
Let's make love in the summertime
Let's make love in the summertime
Be in each other's arms
Let it breathe, let it breathe
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands, make plans
To love in each other's arms, yeah

[Damian Marley:]
Love is universal
Love is going to express itself as a form of forgiveness and compassion for each other

The opening track off of Beyoncé and Jay-Z's collaborative "Everything Is Love" album.


The line "You know it's Cool & Dre" is a reference to Miami producers Cool and Dre who made the instrumentation for this track. Dre told Billboard about the inspiration, "There's a scene where Jay and Bey are on the beach filming each other on the sand and just enjoying the presence of each other, and we took what we saw and put it in the music."


At the beginning "Summer" features additional vocals by Rory from Stone Love.
