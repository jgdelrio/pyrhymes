"Lovehappy" lyrics

The Carters (Beyonce & Jay-Z) Lyrics




"Lovehappy"



Happily in love, haters please forgive me
I let my wife write the will, I pray my children outlive me
I give my daughter my custom dresses, so she gon' be litty
Vintage pieces by the time she hit the city, yeah-ah
Vintage frames, I see nobody fuckin' wit' him
Pretty thug, out the third ward, hit me
Sir asked it, like his dad's shit is trippy (uh-huh)
Twinning, Blue and Rumi, me and Solo are winning!
(Happy in love)
Sitting, dock of the bay wit' a big yacht
Sippin' Yamazaki on the rocks
He went to Jared, I went to Chaumet out in Paris
Yeah, you fucked up the first stone, we had to get remarried
Yo, chill man
We keepin' it real with these people, right?
Lucky I ain't kill you when I met that b.. (nah, aight, aight)
Y'all know how I met her, we broke up and got back together
To get her back, I had to sweat her
Y'all could make up with a bag, I had to change the weather
Move the whole family West, but it's whatever
In a glass house still throwing stones
Hova, Beysus, watch the thrones
(Happy in love)

You did some things to me, boy you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain and I believe you can change
Baby, the ups and downs are worth it, long way to go, but we'll work it
We're flawed but we're still perfect for each other
Sometimes I thought we'd never see the light
Went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night
(Happy in love)

No more clubs and Cali-curfews (one night)
Just private affairs in a tighter circle
Large format wines in small settings, woo
Just hood ass nigga's in designer suits
Follow my moves on a truth in Alaïa boots, yeah, yeah
Amelia Earhart, flyer than who? (yeah, yeah)
Fake news y'all choose, we no lie
No photoshop, just real life
(Happy in love)

You did some things to me, boy you do some things to me
But love is deeper than your pain and I believe you can change
Baby, the ups and downs are worth it, long way to go, but we'll work it
We're flawed but we're still perfect for each other
Sometimes I thought we'd never see the light
Went through hell with heaven on our side
This beach ain't always been no paradise
But nightmares only last one night

Damn, look at us now
Pray, pray for the vows
Way up now, yes, and a way, long way down
We came, and we saw, and we conquered it all
We came, and we conquered, now we're happy in love
