Class Of 3000 Cast Lyrics




"Oh, Peanut"
(from "Class Of 3000" soundtrack)



Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby

Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby

[Eddie:]
Buckhead, yeah, yeah, what
I rap my state, might as well throw it up
See, I been eatin' peanuts and things since I was two
May I recommend the Thai sauce or a soup, scoop

[Li'l D:]
Peanut butter, yeah, or peanut brittle, yeah
Peanut with some jelly and cracker sits in the middle, all right
I've been eating peanut and stuff since I was little
Bankhead, Li'l D, Madison, play your fiddle

[Madison:]
Ditto!

Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
Oh Peanut, we love you, baby
