"Me & My (To Bury Your Parents)"



Me and my mother drivin' to the grocery store
Me ridin' shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustlin' harder, rollers and a nightgown
Me and my father driving to the football game
Me ridin' shotgun, my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughin'
I was much happier when he was around
When he was around, around...

Around...

Me and my mother
Me and my father
Me and my...
Me and my...
Me and...
Me and...
Me...
