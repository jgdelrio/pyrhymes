"The Crayon Song" lyrics

Class Of 3000 Cast Lyrics




"The Crayon Song"
(from "Class Of 3000" soundtrack)



Everybody do the crayon, crayon
Everybody do the crayon, crayon
Everybody do the crayon, crayon
Everybody do the crayon, crayon

Black or blue, purple or yellow or red
Say we're all in this box together, oh yeah, oh yeah
The world is like a coloring book
To get the whole picture each other it took so

Everybody do the crayon, crayon
Everybody do the crayon, crayon
Everybody do the crayon, crayon
Everybody do the crayon, crayon
