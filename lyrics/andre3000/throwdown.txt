Class Of 3000 Cast Lyrics




"Throwdown"
(from "Class Of 3000" soundtrack)



Do I watch cartoons?
Require something to browse it

Talk what you heard, pay your penny
That means I could throwdown, oh yeah
[?] and free your body
When we come to your town, oh, yeah

Jump up and touch the sky
Fall till you hit the dance floor, oh, yeah
I promise if you give it all you got
Every time they want more
Yeah, more, yeah, more, yeah

We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey

We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown

Clap, clap your hands
Tell your mama, "That man throws down"
Ooh, from Atlanta to Japan
Every [?] throwdown, oh, yeah

Jump up and touch the sky
Fall, hit the dance floor, oh, yeah
I promise if you give it all you got
Every time they want more
Yeah, more, yeah, more, yeah

We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey

We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, hey
We throwdown, we throwdown, throwdown

Ooh, wait, we got this thang pumpin' like [?]
I'm, Li'l D and all these drums, I throwdown
That's better than throwin' up
I'm Eddie and with my heart I love you or what

I'm Kim and I'm Kam
I'm on the turntables and I make the keyboard jam
I'm Philly Phil and I play bass
So I got that bottom, bow your bottom

You know who I am, I'm Tamika
And with this here guitar I'm a superstar
Hey, all people, I'm Madison and I'm a [?]
No, Madison, you're supposed to let them know what instrument you play
Oh, um, I play violin and I think we're comin' to the end, bye
