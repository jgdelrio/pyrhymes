Class Of 3000 Cast Lyrics




"Cool Kitty"
(from "Class Of 3000" soundtrack)



I'm so cool I could be an Eskimo
Even in the summer at my house it snows
Ooh, I'm always chillin' like it's forty below
I'm so hot, I'm cold, cool kitty

Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat

Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat

Meet me at the corner of cool and ice
Where all the girls hang out, you know the spots
The cars are fast and the motors are loud
If I were you I would be in the crowd, cool kitty, cool kitty

Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat

Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
Cool kitty, I'm a cool, cool cat
