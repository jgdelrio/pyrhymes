Class Of 3000 Cast Lyrics




"Banana Zoo"
(from "Class Of 3000" soundtrack)



[Gorilla:]
Its about to get bananas in here
Hey look at that ape, over that baby

Banana Zoo, ooh baby, do want you wanna do
Banana Zoo, ooh shawty move like an animal
Now go down low, don't stop now swang like orangutang
Now take it slow, go on an walk now and watch him do his thing
But just don't tap the glass

[Gorilla:]
Don't tap the glass
I'm telling you I'll go crazy
I beat on my chest because I am the best
I'm the king of the jungle
And I ain't lying
Get I ain't lying
I ain't lying
Naw I ain't no lion
Now you can tell King Kong
He don't run this
You can't throw no monkey wrench in this
Now whats the name of my town

Banana Zoo, ooh baby, do want you wanna do
Banana Zoo, ooh shawty move like an animal
Now go down low, don't stop now swing like orangutang
Now take it slow, go on an walk now and watch him do his thing
But just don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass
Don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass, don't tap the glass
Uh oh...
Gorilla go, gorilla go, go, gorilla go, gorilla go, go
Gorilla go, gorilla go, go, gorilla go, gorilla go, go
Now move like a monkey, now move like a monkey, now move like a monkey, now move like a monkey
Hold up!

[Gorilla:]
Hey, can you tell Mr. zookeeper to please order me a 1000 pounds of banana pudding
I would love that
