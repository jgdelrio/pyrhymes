[Everyone:]

[Sunny:]
Now Philly Phil, you and Li'l D, y'all hold that groove tight
Hypnotize them so you can take them where you wanna take them
[Class:]
Hey, Sunny, can we take them to the bridge? Huh, huh, huh?
Hey, Sunny, can we take them to the bridge?
[Sunny:]
Ah, okay

[Madison:]
Oh, I know that one
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down, falling down
London Bridge is falling down

[Class:]
So much reality TV that real life becomes a sitcom
If you ain't got no rhythm
We gon' show you how to get some, yeah

[Kam:]
This beat is ferocious!
[Kim:]
Yeah, like a big ol' tiger!

[Sunny:]
Class of 3000, sing
[Everyone:]
La, la, la...

[Li'l D:]
See, shawty, we gotta show these folks we don't play, even when we do be playin'!

[Sunny:]
Ooh, sound like you've been practicin', Eddie!

[Madison:]
Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do

[Sunny:]
Alright now, just like we rehearsed it!
One, two, one, two, three, here we go
Stay cool now, stay cool, shh, let the music do all the talkin'

[Madison:]
Um, Sunny?

[Sunny:]
Ah, yes, Madison?

[Madison:]
Excuse me but, um, the radio people don't play songs without words anymore

[Sunny:]
Yeah, I know, but don't you worry about that, as long as it's jammin' all the cool people will play it

[Madison:]
Oh...

[Philly Phil:]

[Li'l D:]
Oh, that's fly!

[Sunny:]
Now remember lesson one
Be yourself 'cause no one else can
Take your seat at cool school
That's right, Class of 3000
Be yourself 'cause no one else can
Do that thing like you do
Right again, Class of 3000
And always remember to let 'em know
Where you come from just so they know

[Class:]
Bankhead, Buckhead, go ahead, go ahead
Bankhead, Buckhead, go ahead, go ahead

[Madison:]
Hey, y'all, what about East Point and College Park?

[Class:]
