Class Of 3000 Cast Lyrics




"Fight The Blob"
(from "Class Of 3000" soundtrack)



All right, Westley Funkaneers, today we go to war
I want you to man your instruments
Hello? Well, lady your instruments, whatever
You know what I'm talking about
Because we have a big, big problem on our hands
And I say before we let this blob take over our city
We funk him outta town
Y'all ready?

Blob, you goin' down
Hey, hey, hey, blob, get out of town
The Westley mob gon' make you frown
Hey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down

Nuclear waste, sloppy joe
Where it goes no one knows
Maybe underground where it's found
But it can't play here no more, sing, come on

Nuclear waste, sloppy joe
Where it goes no one knows
Maybe underground where it's found
But it can't play here no more

Hey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down
Hey, hey, hey, blob, get out of town
The Westley mob gon' make you frown
Hey, hey, hey, blob, you goin' down

Well done soldiers, the battle is won
But the war continues
Thanks to every last one of you courageous Funkaneers
Atlanta can sleep tight tonight

Because you faced your problems head on
You didn't run away from 'em
And that's how true players do it
They get straight to it, at ease soldiers
