Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"News Report (Skit)"



"News alert, police wanna find those responsible for murdering"
"Looking for four individuals, they say three of them kicked in the door, the other was driving the getaway car"
"The jewel heist right here in New York City, up to ten million dollars in diamonds stolen"
"A terrifying crime"
"Deputies released some brand new images in this case"
"Police are appealing for the public's help"
"Police now studying the jewels left behind for fingerprints, pouring over surveillance"
"This security footage shows they walk up to a home and knock on the door, holding what appears to be a shotgun"
"The pictures and audio of the torture that took place inside of that home are chilling"
"And they believe that's why the killer or killers..."
