Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Pistol Smoke"
(feat. Solomon Childs)



[Ghostface Killah:]
Yo yeah you can get clapped in a deadly hallway
The killahs skate off in a clean g wagon all grey
Chain swinging the God gods is cocked for ninas
Gucci last thing they seen hitting the cement
The fuck ya'll standing around for watch my reels I make scripts off strips like hold on strip
I don't care what he say how many guns he got just ask your mans about my flics
Movies gruesome bars we boufed it rikers island that phone got bodies on it true shit
A clicks 2 sticks it'll cost you baby
That's 2 pin joints if I lost you baby
Yeah I'm back we can go bar for bar
Tied hands together with the ox go scar for scar
Go ahead and act up injuries gone add up
Walking out the ER like a mummy all wrapped up
Come on board shooters we hiring
Scarface bald head niggas we admire them
Rumor has it alot of frauds got flaws on em
See a lot of madea in niggas wrong draws on em

[Solomon Childs:]
Many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choked and if provoked I let the pistol smoke
Many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choked and if provoked I let the pistol smoke

[Ghostface Killah:]
I held him up like a pair of crutches
Had em all in a jam like I ran with smuckers
Cops sirens paparazzi over hot bodies
Head shots in the mazzarotti
Don't rap that nigga no polo sheets
Keep it discreet I told that nigga he be dead in a week
His bitch told me where he rest where he keep his cheese
He got a stash box in the wheel of both his Vs
I got 47 cocaine connects out in monaco
Top of the line these coke chefs made the honor roll
And that's the reason I don't fuck with faggots
21 guns that go savage
70 nuns that tote smoke in the old baggage
Whatever I see I grab it
You get the message like its all in a tablet
You straight bitch like Tiff Hadish
Hustle grands like Tip Harris
The whole hood drop like a miscarriage

[Solomon Childs:]
Many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choked and if provoked I let the pistol smoke
Many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choke many legs I broke many necks I choked and if provoked I let the pistol smoke
