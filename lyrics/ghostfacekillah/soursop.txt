Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Soursop"
(feat. Masta Killa, Harley & Solomon Childs)



[Harley:]
Give me light light light the way light the way
Give me light give me light
Give me la la la la la la la la la la give me light give me light light light the way
Give me la la la la la la la la give me light

[Ghostface Killah:]
Yeah yo blood clot bust my gun like a rude boy
No love n hip hop bad attitude boy
Jamaican clarks sipping Guinness on the hot sand
Sun splashed I'm on after Elephant Man
My posse paddle through the Cayman in a small canoe
Chewing on chew sticks blowing on ganja root
Fonto leaf Irish moss sour sop big necks
Catching monk fish spice for the crock pot
The powder is wrapped looking like baby roadies
Machine gun mask on looking like a bunch of goalies
The half a foot dread the whole land call em Toby
He got a team of red beam that'll lean the police
Christopher Coke the pistol will smoke gutters
We out in Kingston grooming the dirt for the butters
Sharper machetes that slice through the trees for berries -busting coconuts -Selassie legendary

[Harley:]
Give me light light light the way light the way give me light give me light
Give me la la la la la la la la la la give me light give me light light light the way
Give me la la la la la la la la give me light

[Solomon Childs:]
Siddley diddley diddley diddley diddley and truly right no search and fiddle
Siddley diddley diddley and truly first class
Cold blooded murderer
Tell em tell em tell em tell em what them really require
Cold blooded murderer -Wu Tang the definition of a soldier

[Masta Killa:]
Check this microphone stole of don sippin megaton on point soldiers is on and blow the best corn
Fly silks and wally's women from Jamaica to Bali knowledge me at the show n' prove rally
I miss Allah Real steel I build with this piece of steel they call the microphone chrome nickel plated poems
Jamel Ireef and Iron Man Tone respect shown
In Jamaica there's a party peace to Holmenoti
Eating swordfish and akie
Sliced avocado rice and peas and items sweet like a mango a hundred clip rifle blow steady flow with the tempo more fire the sample go slow
Peace to fire house walsum hayden dale to marvelly jungle to rema salt lane to tiffany gozza spanish town trench town back to max field enough respect due everything real
