Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Flex"
(feat. Harley)



I just wanna flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got the bag tho, running up a check
Cause I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag tho, running up a check
Cause I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna

Ayo, patty cake, patty cake multiplyin' 5 pies
Mountains on the table, take a wiff that's a line drive
Pulling out cocaine biscuits doing drive by's
Bitches butt naked in the kitchen, shorty suck me dry
2 am flights elite jet, furry Louis seats
Alkaline bottles of Don, the whole crew eat
Flex ice water stones as long as begets
The new joint, escalator piece, we flooded the steps
Baby blue passports, Hong Kong Task force
Heard about the murder regime
Made Ghost style mask for us
Bitches with tongue rings, fresh out the geisha house
Did everything to these hoes but never ate them out
N****s can't say shit, there's gold in my bank account
The foul play and the accolades is what my gang about
The knots, big faces falling out my Gucci Sweats
Techs, vests, mother fucker I'm daring you to

Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got the bag tho, running up a check
Cause I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag tho, running up a check
Cause I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna, flex

Yeah, come here, brother
Have you ever seen red Wallos with a Air Max bubble?
And the steel that come with the grip, with the beam this color?
Tomato dot, I cover the ops, if not I'll cut ya
Forbes got young bitches blowing my cover
He's the black Tom Selleck, I been dying to fuck ya
Them Caribbean seminars, he flashy like menopause
Bet you get hit with the best shot, like Pat Benatar
The Oscar winning, his collar is knitted with linen
His Jeans, you could consider it illiterate denim
Fish tank so big, even the babies could swim in
Rocking the toddler, 4 finger laced with ridiculous gems in em
Benjamin's stuck together like boxes of Entemanns
Been in the Vault since 88, with the tape of Rakim and 'em
I got that music ear
I can't leave a chick crib without them trying to keep me as a souvenir

Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport, Benny and the Jets
I just got the bag tho, running up a check
Cause I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
Flex, headed for success
I just bought a passport Benny and the Jets
I just got a bag tho, running up a check
Cause I just wanna, I just wanna
I just wanna, I just wanna
Flex
