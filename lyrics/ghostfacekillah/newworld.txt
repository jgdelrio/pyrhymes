Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"New World"
(feat. Eamon)



[Ghostface Killah:]
Feeling like Outkast lay the stank on ya
Brothers giving dap Trappin on the street corners
Bitches waving hi in the next mans ride
Cause she know she gotta pay them bills trickin on the side
And the kids see so many step fathers is alive
Drinking all the Kool Aid fucking up the vibe
Man there's so many parents just don't understand
How to raise a child educate him teach him how to stand
And not to be a follower people were like toddlers
When there's no love the heart becomes more hollower
Then you wanna be alone the mind becomes shallower
The weak ones hang themselves don't let this life demolish ya
We could dominate the world with a plan
Stand next to each other then we hold hands
Brothers and sisters
Hey Young World
Take it all with a Grain of Sand

[Eamon:]
Its a Deadly Circumstance
From simply getting By
Its a Brainwash drama
To keep it ill advised
Wuuuuuuuuuuu
It make a smart man Stupid
And turn a rich man foolish
We got to man up Stand Up Hands Up
Who who ou ou

[Ghostface Killah:]
See Brothers Get Murdered Over Dice Games
Bullets started to fly when the nights came
You got a bad chick and a nice chain
Be careful them niggas right over there got nice aim
Catch you for a lot or a little bit
It really doesn't matter cause the babies gotta deal with it
Opioid epidemic server with no recollection
Body's last found in the place where the peoples left him
The babies got it harder then ever
They calling them the internet babies
Microwave cellphone towers fake food
Red meat makes the state of mind crazy
Police killing brothers like its OK
It's like a modern day slavery
Everybody stand up man Up
Don't let these wild beasts break us down
And put they hands on Us

[Eamon:]
Its a Deadly Circumstance
From simply getting By
Its a Brainwash drama
To keep it ill advised
Wuuuuuuuuuuuuu
It makes a smart man Stupid
And turns a rich man foolish
We got to man up Stand Up Hands Up
Who who ou ou
Save the children from the pride
Whole world
Show them nothing stops them from that same old vibe
May God save that child
From this world so foul
I want a New World New World
Ou Ou Ou Ou
