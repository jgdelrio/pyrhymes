"Walk Around" lyrics

Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Walk Around"



[Intro - chorus plays along with the intro]
Get the mic on
I don't know what happened, son
I just lost my mind, son
It's like I wasn't strong, G, I couldn't hold it when I seen it
A nigga flesh on me, I can't really-- I couldn't hold it, G
I don't know, I'mma, listen, no I went like this, nigga

[Chorus]
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say...

[Ghostface Killah]
It was him, the cornerstore and a buttered roll
The shit dropped when I gave him two stomach holes
One to the face, he fell sideways
I was up close, so part of his nose was stuck to my padres
Standin' over him shakin', kid, screamin'
He slapped my girl, that's the reason why I was f'in to lean 'im
Everything got real slow, I ain't hear shit, my word
At least 40 seconds, I stay dead stiff
I pound him with the gun out, Big Din came, opened my hand
Removed the gun and the 16 spun out
He floored past 90 on the BQE
I threw up all on his door, splashed his Gucci seats
I couldn't speak, I'm in a state of shock
About now there should be yellow tape on the block, a raid at my spot
Hey, yo, I feel a li'l bugged out, insane, I lost my mind
People tellin' me, Ghost, you actin' mad strange

[Interlude - chorus plays along with interlude]
See what I'm sayin'?  I don't know, I just don't feel right
Havin' flashbacks, bugged out, man, knahmean?
Nah, I don't wanna go to the clinic, I don't want the hospital, son
You know, I just feel like I'm lost, reality, man, y'knahmean?
My face feels numb, son

[Chorus]

[Ghostface Killah]
Flashbacks to me blowin' his brains out
All I remember's my shirt, I couldn't get them goddamned stains out
Oxy cleans wheat 'round the chest area
Righthand side, I'm pluckin' off li'l pieces of meat
And my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee
But I said no, I got these two snow-bunnies in Venice Beach
On the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, in East New York
'Round my man Killa' way where all the murderers walk
Manhunt, police searches, swat ran in my crib
Battering rams, early mornin', yo, waking my kids
Now my aunt gotta stay wit' my wiz
She paranoid, havin' anxiety attacks 'cause of these pigs
Plus my connect, they goin' crazy, they try'na slay me
I told 'em, Friday I'll have they money, faggots try'na play me
I'll never eat up out a garbage can
I'll Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the Father's plan

[Outro 1 - outro 2 plays along with outro 1]
I ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowwhere, I'm aight, I'm aight
But I know one thing, if anybody touch me, I'm blowin' they head smooth off
Cops, connects, I don't give a fuck, they gon' feel that Eagle, they gon' feel that Desert
They gon' feel that Bulldog, y'knahmean?  I don't give a fuck
Don't put me in no mental clinics, it ain't nothin', y'knahmean?
If I make it out alive, I make it out alive, if not, fuck it
Yo, I can't take this shit no more, it's too hype
Niggas thinkin' I'm buggin' out, I ain't buggin'
Y'all niggaz'd be buggin' out too if you had somebody's flesh on you
Motherfuckers, fuck ya'll niggaz, I ain't goin' crazy
Sleepin' on couches and shit... I'm goin' back outside, fuck ya'll niggaz, man

[Outro 2]
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say
I walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze
People talking to me and calling my name
But I don't hear a word they say
I know my Mother's worried about me
'Cause they might have to put me away at any time
'Cause when my baby packed up her clothes and left me
She oh!  I believe she took my mind...
