Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Enemies All Around Me"
(feat. William Hart)



[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
I formed a crew, niggas straight tell me I'm slippin'
I'm the boss of the fam, I need to watch my position
Bitches are sneaky, triflin', and not to be trusted
A weak link in the team, in the chain of combustion
Don't trust her, love is for suckas
Too many enemies is out there son, tryin' to bring the ruckus
Keep a tight circle, don't let her rain on your parade
Keep doin' what we're doin', gettin' money and gettin' paid

[Hook: William Hart]
Enemies all around me
One mistake and they'll down me
They just wanna rain on my parade
I said the enemies all around you
One mistake and they'll down you
They just wanna rain on your parade

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
It's mind-boggling the heart wants it, the mind rejects it
Fuck the past, let's put the present in perspective
That's my lady, she would never back-stab or cross me
Stand butt-naked in the storm, sippin' the frosty
Force me to choose, I'mma follow my heart
She was there from the beginning, but I tore 'em apart
No more Delucas, straight Killa Bee on the swarm
And when it's time to get big, she put her game face on

[Hook: William Hart]
