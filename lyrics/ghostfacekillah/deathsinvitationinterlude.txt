Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Death's Invitation Interlude"
(feat. RZA)



[RZA:]
Breaking into the home of Luther Luca, Lester finds Logan hiding with her son
Logan is the ex-mistress of Tony Starks
Yeah, that's that bitch that set him up to be killed
He confronted Logan about the past
She confessed, but she had remorse for her betrayal
She also confessed the unknown truth about the young boy
He was Tony Starks'
Secret son...
