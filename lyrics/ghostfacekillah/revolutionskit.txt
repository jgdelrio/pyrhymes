"Revolution (Skit)" lyrics

Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Revolution (Skit)"



And you talk about black criminals
Baby, no, we haven't had it this bad in a long, long time
And you talk about police violence? Police crimes?
There is a proliferation of police assaults on the black community, all over the country
We cannot succumb to the notion of history that prevails in this country
Now, like the American Revolution, you know?
I mean, what is the American Revolution today?
You talk about revolution today?...
