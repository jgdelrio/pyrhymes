Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Introduction"
(feat. Michael Rappaport)



[Michael Rapaport:]
Yeah, yes
You hear that motherfuckin' soul shit?
You hear that shit
Soul rap, R&B
Dusty soul rap, Ghostface Killah
Tony Starks
Motherfuckin' pretty Tony
Starkey Love
The Wallabe Champ
Deanie, Ghost Deanie
Sun God
Motherfuckin' Iron Man
The man, his name Ghostface Killah
This is The Lost Tapes, my name is Michael Rapaport
This is an honor and a motherfuckin' privilege to walk you through the beauty of the Ghostface Killah Lost Tapes
You hear that dusty soul shit? I love it
Yo, without further ado, comin' in right now: Ghostface Killah, the icon
Shit, the motherfucker needs no introduction
I don't even know why I'm doin' this shit
Yo, Deanie, do what the fuck you do

[Ghostface Killah:]
Hey cocksucker, yes, 80
Yo, what's good? What's good-what's good-what's good?
Yo, yo, yo, check it out y'all, I found The Lost Tapes
I found that Lost Tapes, Champ, let's go
I'ma send it over to you so we can just blast off with that shit one time and shit, aight?
So holla at me when you get to me, man
Just, uh, hit me back
Hit me back
You know what it is
Truth with the golden voice
One
