Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Waffles & Ice Cream"
(feat. Cappadonna)



(Ma! Ma!)
(Throw down some money!)
(The Ice Cream Man is comin'!)

Yo, Shaolin's finest, what up Boo, peace, your highness, let's rewind this
Both get naked and kill the shyness
Wu Tang's timeless, blow out your sinus
Sweet talk that ass to the bed, kill em with kindness
I'm thinking we should fuck again
Get back to the sucking and
Freak shit, all on the road we keep trucking in
Bottle of Rose Double G's on the sneaker
Let me slide in love, I got respect like Aretha

(Ice cream! Ice cream!)

Watch these rap dudes slide all up in your text
French, vanilla, butter pecan, we complex
Even carmel sundaes, they gone flex
And scooped in the ice cream truck, let's have sex

My tenderoni she was young when I first wet her
Little niggas from the hood used to upset her
I'm from the era of blowing kisses and love letters
Big wheels and skates now I'm skating on big wheels
Loving my honey buns and I'm giving em big thrills
We build and destroy it's different how shit feels
When the boys turn to men, dick shit get real
Look at my shorty and get clapped with steel
Hit with the Jason, these save a hoe niggas is fuck facing
Lard niggas pure bacon
Doo Doo Head fed nigga think he down with my click click
Homicide housing some times I fuck me a quick bitch
Its the goony, hillbilly drip
Hashtag Ruck juice and we don't give a fuck about none of ya'll, fuck you
Its the odd couple all night fucking Honeys on site
Chick like to sing on my dick just like a long mic

(Ice cream! Ice cream!)

Yo, yo, honey dip, summer time fine jewelry dripping
Its been a minute let your boy get back up in it
No fake digits, no ex to the next, let's text
Meet up at the spot and have sex
Lo specs, big jewels hanging off the Cuban
Wrist iced up, the hotel room is boomin'
Boozing, butt naked in the jacuz we cooling

(Ice cream)

Watch these rap dudes slide all up in your text
French vanilla butter pecan we complex
Even caramel sundaes they gone flex
And scooped in the ice cream truck, let's have sex
