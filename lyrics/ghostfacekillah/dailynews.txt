Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Daily News"



Daily news reporting a massacre
Crime fam against fam
Streets is a war zone, blood bath
Running for protection
Kane's against DeLucas, bullets in both directions
Duck at the safe house and re-up your ammo
It's a battlefield out here and they're moving with camo
Ayo, headline reads "Bodies is left butchered"
Whole family killed and tossed in the bushes
It's a massacre bringing out the faces of death
Ayo, Wigs, tell priest how they murdered the rest
