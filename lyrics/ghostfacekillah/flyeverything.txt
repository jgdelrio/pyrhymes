Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Fly Everything"
(feat. Sun God & Shawn Wigs)



[Ghostface Killah:]
(Yeah here we go baby let's go)
Yo Big Paper sky scrapers the black Jerry Buss I can Buy the Lakers Fly Everything
Stand on the Bentley and toast the stones in every ring
Forty helicopters with choppers Back to Medellin
Undercover Task force reveals they get chills when on the heels of a killer way iller with his mask off
3 stooge of these niggas leave em in the Dust on the crash coarse
I don't even ask for the pussy Wizzes Pass off
Cinco d mayo or Enter the bayou One hell of a Bio
I live that life you could stuff in a vial
Black 590 Mossberg will knock off you smile
Tony wrist game water like it was dipped in the Nile
40 inch cable is fatal I need a Neck Brace
The gold I wore will weigh more then your table
Jameson bags of scotch the red dot on the label
If Chi town is Chirack then Staten island is Beirut

[Shawn Wigs:]
All we wants the Dead Presidents
Take measurements - you follow the old we making New Testaments
Supreme specimens Wu Tang Regiments
Watch ya mouth when you speaking to Excellence

[Sun God:]
I probably left a couple scene's but that's only threw back exits
Mommy crying homie died couldn't make it past 11
22 20 gun salute bring him back in seconds
For that juice hang em off the roof
How niggas send a message
We be walking keep that toolie on us
Case you wanna check it
Off the line and get your Homie cracked
Just for sending texts
Every spot homie JJ Watt known to get them Texans
Quiet down everybody now God will send the message
Its my culture for what you worth
But you ain't life threatening
You ain't' running just drag your feet
Cause you ain't light stepping
Send a mark to come dim your lights
Don't need a light inspection
Just give em a couple shots
We gonna give him light injections
I'm cleaning these niggas messes but soon as I switch my groove I got out and move
These niggas became the death wish
Niggas became reckless Thugged out and flexing [*echo*] Thugged out and flexing

[Shawn Wigs:]
All we wants the Dead Presidents
Take measurements - you follow the old we making New Testaments
Supreme specimens Wu Tang Regiments
Watch ya mouth when you speaking to Excellence
