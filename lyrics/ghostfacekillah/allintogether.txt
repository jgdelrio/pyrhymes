Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"All In Together"
(feat. Styles P & Jadakiss)



My gun heavy way, you was banned away
Soon as you catch a couple hoes, use a man of faith
Snitching, you know how many mother fuckers got the head blown down for snitching
Stress me, you ain't convincing
And this to be the same club, you can't [?]
And little be the same blood, you can't [?]
Doctor bills don't play, they spend it

[Chorus: x2]
All you're giving now
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club
Who want ladies is living now
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!

Scary niggas shoot with their eyes closed
Me I got killers, no blinking, just coke on their nostrils
If you ain't with us, you consider this hostile
[?] I ain't talking about cascos
Whatever you can bet it, where your gun is on, let it
I've been riding dirty way before [?] and said it
Chasing at the club, throwing cheers at 'em
Bitches just throwing benz at 'em
Shout in, jump off the stairs at 'em

[Chorus: x2]
All you're giving now
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club
Who want ladies is living now
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!

When it's on nigga, I don't care how you rock
I shoot it up till the property value drop
You used to play gun defence, now you're fly
Morals, principles, should I ball you out?
Enough [?] better send the word to the monkeys
[?] like me in a third world country
Head guns, govern the issue, we still banging them
As soon as he sitting the passenger seat, strangulate them!

[Chorus: x2]
All you're giving now
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club
Who want ladies is living now
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!

Make it where this mother fucker don't come back
Six feet deep where my gun's at
This is [?] little dudes [?] cop
Come from the spot, with them niggas to get you [?]
Yeah, life's a bitch, so I'm fucking up
Every day you never gave a fuck about a fuck boy anyway

[Chorus: x2]
All you're giving now
Keep that thing making now bouncing about the club
Who want ladies is living now
Make it where this mother fucker, they don't come back!
Make it where this mother fucker wear a big hat!
