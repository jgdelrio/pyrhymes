"Back At Ringside" lyrics

CZARFACE & Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Back At Ringside"



We are rockin' ringside in this
Ill niggas are crowned the kingdom of the madness system
Greatest intercontinental heavyweight champion of all time
Unjustifiably in a position I'd rather not be, BG Oakerland
And I'm talkin' about CZARFACE, yeah
And I'm talkin' about 7L
And I'm talkin' about MC Esoteric, yeah
And the rebel INS, formidable opposition
And they say that every hero needs a villain
And I'm that guy
So let me give you a little piece of advice, or a face in
Don't hunt what you can't kill
And Ghostface, you call yourself the iron man?
Let's see how you hold up in a steel cage match
MC Esoteric's gettin' the Boston crab
CZARFACE is in the danger zone
Ooh, yeah
All-star feelin', my G, you should see the team
All-star feelin', my G, you should see the team
All-star feelin', my G, you should see the team
Former great, spoken word, world circulatin'
