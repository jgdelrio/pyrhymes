Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Let The Record Spin Interlude"
(feat. RZA)



[RZA:]
Seeking assistance to help eradicate those responsible for the murder of his family
Lester plays one of the records
Summoning the spirit of Ghostface Killah right before his eyes
Lester plees the Ghostface to help him

Ghostface offers Lester the use of his power
But only if he agrees to relinquish his body and soul
Once the ghastly deed is complete
Lester makes the deal
A deal
For his life
