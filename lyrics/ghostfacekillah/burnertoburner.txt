Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Burner To Burner"
(feat. Inspectah Deck & Cappadonna)



Yeah baby, you know what it is, Yap City
All day, c'mon
This shit make you wanna smack shit off top
Word up, check it
Yeah, y'all niggas is goin' to hell, yo

I pledge allegiance to crime, right hand on the burner
Death to all cornball niggas who wanna turn up
I call it getting it in, you call it animosity
Listen, you could never match my velocity
Too much stamina, glitter in front of cameras
On the red carpet, still clean your clock like a janitor
Favorite Pac joint was "I Ain't Mad At'cha"
Skinny jean faggot, you ain't man enough
You ain't got the heart to snuff, plus cut stab or bust
We wrestle down elephants, 200 grand per tusk
The ball spinners, spilling spades on Asian women
Love them pretty black joints a little Malaysian in them
Ghost gotta gambling habbit I burn bookies
Smack so many promoters out here, they scared to book me

Scared to book niggas, your highness
Diamonds on the Yankee sign, dirt on the camo
6 stones flooded the left hand like Thanos
While you sambo's dance to Bo Jangles
I'm verified, toasting on boats with hosts damsels
Yeah son, I'm loving the hate
That's why I keep knife on me so I'm sure to get a cut of the cake
Now my name hold double the weight
That's an actual fact
Them million plus motha fuckas relate
Yeah, I'm on them heavy bags like Deontay
And I'm wild caught ya'll niggas farmed raised
For 50 cent I went to war with many men
And slap em with the jacket like Benny Hinn
I'm hitting that jet fuel, you're new in the game, lame
You'll never use Deck for a step stool

They don't wanna hear that shit they want Dorothy
Fire coming outta my mouth now that's an arseny
I'm so hood toss the nine when I left it
Rubber bands wrapped around my darts the more I stretch it
When it come back I pop that sucka shit
I smoke blunts and I spit on that rhetoric
Original tyzeme, S.I. gutter
Let's get it right fuck you and your brother
My raps in the back of your head like 2 mufflers
So pull your dress up your raps ain't tough enough
Niggas cuddle up with the wife they can't come out
I'll be at he club all night, I might dumb out
You fuck around with big dogs, ain't no bark here
Fuck you and your friends, nigga, you can't park here
