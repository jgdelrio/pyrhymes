Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"Me, Denny & Darryl"
(feat. Method Man & Cappadonna)



Yo
Yo, yeah
Foreign cars, we copping 'em
Hopping in with glocks in 'em
Stick up kids on dead end streets
We pop em first, we box em in
Behind the wheel, the drivers hit and gasping for that oxygen
Tryin' to find whatever holes that he can tie his sock up in
And stop the bleeding lot a reasons lot a goons they wanna eat em
Money pop a lotta shit, his stick up game is outta season
First time I scoped in front of subways eating pizza
He didn't even peep us
This is practice, thugging with free access
Original hit man, boss suited and weird glasses
Guns that stop traffic ain't afraid to blast it, bitch
This is Iraq iron not plastic
We hog tie, duck tape, take long drives
You in the trunk balls out naked, you gon' die
Any place on Gods green earth you gon' fry
Night, night, you going to bed, but not to the Stuy

Ayo, Hempty demp, I like rice and shrimp
If I can't get on a plane then I'm catching a blimp
Told a brown skin, "Yeah you could call me a pimp"
But I'm the real orphan of rap I got lost from the pack
The streets had me trapped I ain't know where I was at
Weeded and saucy, black jeans, jewelry glossy
Early in the morning, toast and coffee
You can't off me, your wack flow suck and exhaust me
I got New York heat, bought to fuck a chic shortly
I'm bow legged with darts, can't none of ya'll walk me
Honey's love me, follow me everywhere, stalk me
I'm good with the hoo tang hut, my army tense up
You can't inch up, don't even flinch up
Honey's get wet and they panties be all drenched up
I'm coming off the bench like I'm blowing the bench up
Black crown, black apparel black nun chucks
36 is hard to kill, we put a fence up
Armored tank Masta Killa shit, black Benz truck

Cauliflower Wallabees, Turkey legs, collard greens
Dollar dreams, if I'm not the T'Challa then what kinda king
Am I, my persona, man its nada, this is not a thing
Island got Italians load the tallons and the badda bings
Make em sing this is not Sopranos ya'll don't make a scene
Making cream, how I make it up with out the Maybelline
Can with the laser beam, your favorite team's
Not the playground to play around with, just try and take a swing
Yada mean? It's not a see saw battle, not the bridge you wanna travel
'Cause your life expectancy on the Verrazano is narrow
It's 'Me Denny and Darryl'
Just before my hand cock you can C. the Smith on the barrel
Hit the gravel, forever be in my shadow
Rather be up in the saddle than up the creek with no paddle
Key to the city, judge throw away the gavel
Since the game got pretty it don't go with my apparel
