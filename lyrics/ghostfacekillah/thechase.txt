Ghostface Killah Lyrics




"The Chase"
(feat. Sun God)



[Ghostface Killah:]
Yo speed up lord they moving on us
Unmarked cars with dogs yo they shooting at us
Light the weed up for God sake it's ok call up Abee
Tell em give Ricky the cash eat a half she's my wife
Give my white beans to white
Watch where you going nigga breaths a right
Yo watch the bitch hop the curb racist ass Jake wildin screaming out racial slurs
Stay calm and be patient gripped the God u nation next time they pull out from the trunk we blazing
Big shit going off blow blow blow blow
Shawn Bell up in his grave wildin out
If we get caught son my lawyer's in Boston
He got a hundred thou to retain with mad frosting
Yo so don't panic stay well planted tre' pound
Poking my dick I pulled the shit out and start blasting

[Sun God:]
Without asking homie throw the ratchet
I guess I'm here to audible to play John Madden
So switch lanes do a buck no laughing
I double hop the road and go to the gassing
Dog you imagine pigs on our ass we on point
We ain't got no where to throw the ratchet
I'm on point clap that bitch this shit tragic
I'm down for whatever make it happen

[Ghostface Killah:]
Yo yo quick toss the bomb in the garbage
Come here shorty take this revolver
You get caught don't say its your fathers
Don't say my name say you found it in Yonkers
In the park around a bunch of monsters
Your turning it in cause it was on your conscience
Big boy toys them shits go bonkers
Cause we play foul we don't want no charges

[Sun God:]
Fuck that shit pass that shit over here g
Hit the backyard throw that shit in the tan jeep
As soon as you see the cops automatically plan b
Soon as you hit the spot throw a shot in the air please
I'm coming
Know I'm always there when you need me
And no I ain't Dre I just do it that Eazy
A hundred miles and running I'm a do it for TV
Before we leave the car leave them gloves and that ear piece -we out
