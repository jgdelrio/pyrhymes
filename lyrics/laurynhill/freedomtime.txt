Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Freedom Time"



Everybody knows that they're guilty
Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they're guilty
Resting on their conscience eating their inside

It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
Time to get free, oh give yourselves up now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time

Yo, there's a war in the mind
Over territory for the dominion
Who will dominate the opinions
Schisms and isms, keepin' us in forms of religion
Conformin' our vision
To the world church's decision
Trapped in a section
Submitted to committee election
Moral infection
Epidemic lies and deception
Insurrection
Of the highest possible order
Distortin' our tape recorders
From hearin' like under water

Beyond the borders
Fond of sin and disorder
Bound by the strategy
It's systemic depravity
Heavy as gravity
Head first in the cavity
Without a bottom
A fate worse than Sodom

What's got 'em
Drunk off the spirits
Truth comes, we can't hear it
When you've been programmed to fear it

I had a vision
I was fallin' in indecision
Appallin', callin' religion
Some program on television
How can dominant wisdom
Be recognized in the system
Of Anti-Christs and majority rules
Intelligent fools

PhD's in illusion
Masters of mass confusion
Bachelors of past illusion
Now who you choosin'
The head or the tail
The bloodshed of the male
Or confidence in the veil
Conferences at Yale
Discussin' doctrines of Baal
Causin' people to fail
Keepin' the third in jail

His word has nailed
Everything to the tree
Severing all of me
From all that I used to be

Formless and void
Totally paranoid
Enjoying darkness as Lord
Keepin' me from the sword

Block for mercy
Bitter than Ceres
Hungry and thirsty
For good meat we would eat
And still dine at the table of deceit
How incomplete
From confrontation to retreat
We belong to true enemyâ€™s defeat

Destitute, a necessity
Causin' desperation to get the best of me
Punishment 'til there was nothing left of me
Realizin' the inescapable death of me
No options in the valley of decision
The only doctrine, supernatural circumcision
Inwardly, only water can purge the heart
From words that fiery darts
Thrown by the workers of the arts

Iniquity, shaping in
There's no escapin' when
Your whole philosophy is paper-thin
In vanity
The wide road is insanity
Could it be all of humanity

Picture that
Scripture that
The origin of a man's heart is black
How can we show up for
An invisible war
Preoccupied with a shadow
Makin' love with a whore
Achin' in sores

Babylon, the great mystery
Mother of human history
System of social sorcery
Our present condition
Needs serious recognition
Where there's no repentance there can be no remission

And that sentence, more serious than Vietnam
The atom bomb, and Saddam and Minister Farakkhan
What's goin' on, what's a priority to you
By what authority do we do
When the majority hasn't a clue
We majored in curses
Search the chapters, check the verses
Recapture the land
Remove the mark from off our hands
So we can stand
In agreement with his command
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand
Everything else is damned
Let them with ears understand

It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, said it's freedom time now
It's freedom, I'ma be who I am
It's freedom time, said it's freedom time

Everybody knows that they've lied
Everybody knows that they've perpetrated inside
Everybody knows that they're guilty, yes
Resting on their conscience eating their insides

Get free, be who you're supposed to be
Freedom, said it's freedom time now
Freedom, said it's freedom time
Freedom, freedom time now
