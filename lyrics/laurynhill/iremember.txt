"I Remember" lyrics

Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"I Remember"



I remember, when you looked into my eyes
You saw right through me
And I could not hide
I was exposed, just like a child

All of my heart, you hold in your hands
I'm yours to command
I'm yours to command

I, I feel so humbled
With you in my life
With you in my life

I remember, when I looked into your eyes
I saw a reflection of myself
And I could not lie, out of control
Too weak to deny

All of myself is naked before you
But what can I do?
There's nothing I can do

I feel so beautiful
With you in my life
With you in my life

I remember, I remember, I remember, I
With you in my life
With you in my life
