"The Sweetest Thing" lyrics

Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"The Sweetest Thing"
(from "Love Jones" Soundtrack)



The sweetest thing I've ever known
Was like the kiss on the collarbone
The soft caress of happiness
The way you walk, your style of dress
I wish I didn't get so weak
Oooh, baby, just to hear you speak
Makes me argue just to see
How much you're in love with me
See, like a queen, a queen upon her throne

It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know

I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay
Warm as the sun dipped in black
Fingertips on the small of my back
More valuable than all I own
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious, precious favorite dark skin tone

It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know

It was the...Ah
I tried to explain
Ah...but baby, it's in vain, o-o-oh

Speaking on my mother's phone
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)
Sweet prince of the ghetto
Your kisses taste like amaretto
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone

It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know
It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know

Ahhh, sometimes, watch you in your sleep
Ahhh, excuse me if I get too deep, hey

It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest ....
