Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill"



My world it moves so fast today
The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes  so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I've tried to be
What someone else  thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

But deep in my heart
The answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
To define my own destiny 

I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me

And deep in my heart
the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
to define my own destiny
And deep in my heart
the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind
to define my own destiny
