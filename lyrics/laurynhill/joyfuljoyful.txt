"Joyful, Joyful" lyrics

Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Joyful, Joyful"
(feat. St. Francis Choir)
(from "Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit" Soundtrack)



Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Hail Thee as the sun above
Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light
Fill us with the light
Oh, fill us with the light of day

Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Clearly as the sun above

Melt the clouds of sin, sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Drive it away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us
Fill us with the light of day
Light of day

Check the rhyme
What's up?
Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
And in my life I put none before Thee
Since I was a youngster I came to know
That you were the only way to go

So I had to grow and I come to an understanding
And I'm down with the King
So now I'm demanding
That you tell me "Who you down with?" see
All I know is that I'm down with G.O.D.
You down with G.O.D.?

Yeah, you know me
You down with G.O.D.?
Yeah, you know me
You down with G.O.D.?
Yeah, you know me
Who's down with G.O.D.?
Everybody

Come and join the chorus
The mighty, mighty chorus
Which the morning stars began
The Father of Love is reigning over us

By the way!
What have you done for Him lately
What have you done for Him lately
He watches over everything
So we sing!

Joyful, joyful
Lord we adore Thee
God of Glory, Lord of Love
Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee
Hail Thee as the sun above

Melt the clouds of sin and sadness
Drive the dark of doubt away
Giver of immortal gladness
Fill us with the light
Fill us with the light
Oh, fill us with the light of day

Fill us (Fill us with the light of day Lord, oh fill
Us)
Fill us (Oh we need you yes we do, ooh fill us)
Fill us

Fill us (With the light of day Lord)
Fill us (Fill us as we pray, Lord)
Fill us (With the light of day Lord)

Fill us (We need you, we need you to pray, we need
You, need you today)
Fill us (We need you I'm gonna say)
Fill us (Fill us, fill us, fill us, fill us!)

Fill us
Fill us with the light of day
Light of day!
