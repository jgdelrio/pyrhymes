"Just Want You Around" lyrics

Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Just Want You Around"



I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around
I just want you around

Thought that I had lost you
I can hardly make a sound
When I thought I couldn't hold you
Knew the world had let me down
Should have took the time to tell you
You keep my feet on the ground
I hope that you can hear me
Cause I know its not profound

I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around

When I thought I was without you
I got used to being down
It was my fault I used to doubt you
But that aint me next time around
Please believe me when I tell you
Cause all my words are bound
This is my cross now let me bare it
I was lost but now I'm found-found-found

I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around

Took this love for granted
Kept my feelings underground
Should have watered what I planted
Should have known what I have found
I'm not used to being lonely
I don't like the way it sounds
You're the only one I know-yeah
Who don't turn my upside-down

I just want you around
I just need you around
I just want you around
I just need you around
Yeah I want you around
I just need you around .......
