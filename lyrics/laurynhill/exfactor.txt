Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Ex-Factor"



It could all be so simple
But you'd rather make it hard
Loving you is like a battle
And we both end up with scars

Tell me, who I have to be?
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

Is this just a silly game
That forces you to act this way,
Forces you to scream my name,
Then pretend that you can't stay?

Tell me, who I have to be?
(I know we gotta do)
To get some reciprocity
(You know, you know)
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
This is crazy

I keep letting you back in
How can I explain myself
(I don't understand why)
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else

See, I know what we've got to do
You let go and I'll let go too
'Cause no one's hurt me more than you
And no one ever will

No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't workin'
It ain't workin'
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy
This is crazy

Care for me, care for me
I know you care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?

Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?

Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?

Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me

Care, there, cry, give

Where were you
When I needed you?

Care, there, cry, give

Where were you
When I needed you?
