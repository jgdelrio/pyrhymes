"Guarding The Gates" lyrics

Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Guarding The Gates"
(from "Queen & Slim" soundtrack)



Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you going to
What you running from
What you going through
Where you coming from
What you going through
Where you coming from

Everybody, everybody wants to know
What you gonna do
Where you going to
'Cause they wanna come
Where I'm showing you
Yes, they wanna come
Where I'm showing you

All that you could be is a spectacle
Following after every single miracle
Watch them marvel at
All the joy you have
But they're too important to have all the joy you have
What a tragedy, you can laugh at me, you can laugh at me

But I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love
Don't you wish you had real love
Yes, I'm in love

Tryna fix myself for society
Tryna mix myself for society
But can you tell me where is love in anxiety?
Can you tell me where is love in anxiety?

What you say to me
I don't mind at all
What you say to me
I don't really care at all
'Cause I'm in love
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

Watch them speculate
All the life you live
Watch them try to hate
All the love you give
All the love you give

Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you going to
'Cause they wanna come
Or so they think, until they find the cost of it
Till they found out, found out what you lost for it
And I'll do it all again
'Cause I found love
'Cause I found love
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

Everybody, everybody wants to know
Where you going to
What you running from
What you going through
Where you coming from
What you going through
Where you're coming from

Everybody, everybody wants to know
What you gonna do
Where you going to
'Cause they wanna come
Where I'm showing you
Yes, they wanna come
Where I'm showing you

All that you could be is a spectacle
Following after every single miracle
Watch them marvel at
All the joy you have
But they're too important to have all the joy you have
What a tragedy, you can laugh at me, you can laugh at me

But I'm in love
Yes, I'm in love
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Yes, I'm in love

So what you say to me, I don't even mind at all
What you say to me, I don't even care at all
'Cause I'm in love
Don't you wish you had real love?
I know you do
Don't you wish you had real love?

These broken thoughts in my mind
Can't let them get down in there
Can't let them get down in there
These broken thoughts in my mind
Can't let them get down in there
Can't let them get down in there
'Cause I need real love
I need real love
I'm guarding, guarding the gates

Oh, I'm guarding my gates
