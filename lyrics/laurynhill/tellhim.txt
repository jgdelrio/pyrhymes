"Tell Him" lyrics

Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Tell Him"



Yo heh heh tell him it's like uhh you know uhh
Sweet sweet tell him

Let me be patient let me be kind
Make me unselfish without being blind
Though I may suffer I'll envy it not
And endure what comes
Cause he's all that I got and
Tell him...

Tell him I need him (yeah)
Tell him I love him (tell him)
And it'll be alright
[Background singing] Tell him be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

Now I may have faith to make mountains fall
But if I lack love then I am nothin' at all
I can give away everything I possess
But left without love then I have no happiness
I know I'm imperfect (I know I'm imperfect)
And not without sin (and not without sin)
But now that I'm older all childish things end
And tell him...

Tell him I need him (yeah)
Tell him I love him (tell him)
And it'll be alright
[Background singing] Tell him be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright

[Bridge]
I'll never be jealous
And I won't be too proud
Cause love is not boastful
Oooh and love is not loud
Tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
Everything's gonna be alright [w/ ad libs]
Oooh oooh yeah yeah aww yeah

Now I may have wisdom and knowledge on Earth
But if I speak wrong then what is it worth?
See what we now know is nothing compared
To the love that was shown when our lives were spared
And tell him...

Tell him I need him (yeah)
Tell him I love him (tell him)
And it'll be alright
[Background singing] Tell him be alright be alright
Tell him tell him I need him
Tell him I love him
It'll be alright
