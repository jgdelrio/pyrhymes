"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You" lyrics

Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You"
(originally by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons)



You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

(I want you, I want you)

Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

(I want you, I want you)

I need you baby, if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say, "OK." (It's OK)
Oh, pretty baby, "Don't let me down," I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby, let me love you, oh, baby

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

(I want you, I want you)

I need you baby, and if it's quite alright
I need you baby to warm a lonely night
I love you baby
Trust in me when I say, "It's OK."
Oh, pretty baby, "Don't let me down," I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby, let me love you, oh, baby

I need you baby, if it's quite alright
I love you baby, you warm a lonely night
I need you baby
Trust in me when I say, "It's OK."
Oh, oh, pretty baby, "Don't let me down," I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh, baby, let me love you, oh, baby
