Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"His Eye Is On The Sparrow"
(feat. Tanya Blount)
(from "Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit" Soundtrack)



[Tanya Blount:]
Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart feel lonely
And long for heaven and home

When Jesus is my portion
A constant friend is he
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches over me
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches me

[Lauryn Hill:]
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow

And I know he watches me
[Tanya:] He watches me
[Lauryn:] His eye is on the sparrow
And I know he watches
[Tanya:] I know he watches
[Lauryn:] I know he watches me

[Lauryn and Tanya:]
I sing because I'm happy
I sing because I'm free
His eye is on the sparrow

[Lauryn:] And I know he watches me
[Tanya:] He watches me
[Lauryn and Tanya:] His eye is on the sparrow
[Tanya:] And I know he watches me
[Lauryn:] He watches me
[Tanya:] He watches me, I know
[Lauryn and Tanya:] He watches me
