"Friend Or Foe '98" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"Friend Or Foe '98"



I'm done talking
Ran up in the spot gun smoking
Shot it in the air, one woke him
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo
Thinking to himself what done provoked him
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan
I swear I saw a lightbulb when
He finally figured out who was the culprit
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be
Plus I had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys
And it wasn't afterthought that maybe you'll try to revenge me
But I was like "Nah", Chromes had to know he was wrong
And if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song
Plus you promised
And that's really no fun 
Yeah I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon
But my mind's like a flower in bloom
*** my eyes just scower the room
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a 2 hotel town? 
Come on now, I peep your Lexus at you
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town
Money well invested, rudely interrupted
Jamaican accents *** 
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?
I'm done talking, back up and clap them, one in the abdomen 
Do me a favor dude, get 2 ice cubes I pass them
Take that ice up, for the nicest MC
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable 
Friend or foe BIOTCH!
