"Feelin It" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"Feelin It"



[Chorus:]
I'm feelin it fill the glass to the top with Moet
Feelin it feel the Lex pushin up on the set
I'm feelin it through the high that you get from the lie
Feelin it if you feel it raise your l in the sky

[Verse 1:]

I keep it realer than most I know your feelin it
Cristal on ice I like to toast I keep on spillin it
Bone crushers I keep real close I got the skill for this
On my back the fliest clothes lookin ill and shit
Transactions illegitimate cause life is still a bitch 
And then you die but for now life close your eyes and feel this dick
Since diapers had nothin to live for like them lifers but 
Makin sure every nigga stay rich within my cipher
We paid the price to circular success they turned my mic up
I'm 'bout to hit these niggas wit some shit that a light they life up
If every nigga in your clique is rich your clique is rugged
Nobody will fall cause everyone would be each others crutches 
I hope you fools choose to listen I drop jewels bust it
These are the rules I follow in my life you gotta love it
Jiggy jigger lookin gully in the joint 
If y'all niggas ain't talkin 'bout large money what's the point?

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]

Even if it ain't sunny hey I ain't complainin 
I'm in the rain doing a buck 40 hydroplanin what shorty
(Where you disappear son?)
Maintainin puttin myself in a position most of these rappers ain't in
I'm livin the ill streets blues got you hunger painin
Nothin to gain and a whole lot to lose you still singin fool
I'm thorough in every boro my name be ringin
Warmin it up for the perfect time to hit your brain and 
Ya Feelin it? to all the girls I bought the girdle to conceal my bricks
No doubt they can vouch my life is real as shit 
95 south and poppy on the hill and shit
And all the towns like Cambridge that I killed wit shit
And all the thorough ass niggas that I hustle wit 
Throw your joints in the air one time and bust your shit
These fake rappers cant really know I'm lovin it ya feelin it

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 3:]

What y'all ain't heard that nigga Jay high? 
The Cristals they keep me wet like Baywatch
I keep it tight for all the nights my mom prayed I'd stop 
Said she had dreams that snipers hit me with a fatal shot
Those nightmares mom
Those dreams you say you got give me the chills
But these mils make me hot y'all feel me
Enough to stop the illin right?
But at the same time these dimes keep me feelin tight 
I'm so confused
OK I'm gettin weeded now I know I'm contradicting myself
Look I don't need that now 
It just once in a blue moon when there's nothin to do and
The tension's too thick for my sober mind to cut through
I get to zonin, me and the chick on the island and we're bonin'
I free my mind sometimes I here myself moanin
Take one more toke and I leave that weed alone man
It got me goin shit

[Chorus x3]
