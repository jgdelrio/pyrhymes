"Guns & Roses" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"Guns & Roses"
(feat. Lenny Kravitz)



Yeah it's magic
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz
And it's a Heavy D product you bastards
Come on
Ha hey yo stop playing man
This is real serious
Ha (It's the rock) yeah yo

[Jay-Z]
Post Postatono, Hov' hanging with Bono
You too can live like Salvatore Ferragamo
And you too can cool out poolside after Delano
And you too flow like you was out of your mind yo
And who knew dude who loved apple pies from McDonald's
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know
And who knew dude would play ball for the NBA
Would make a mistake on the who know it stayed still in the way
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today
Now there's something you gotta say two times to Jay
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action
Its safe when you play with skills, good luck could happen
Let's go

(C'mon) It's the Roc [repeat 4X]
That's right

[Jay-Z]
It got to hot so I jumped off in this rap shit
You got it criss-crossed ain't no turning me backwards
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions
Of one individual he's criminally attached
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors
While dating all the models and actresses
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio
Trying not to mess up my axis kid
On the road to riches through trafficking
Through rappining whatever's happening
Roc-a-wear I'm the young black Ralph Lauren
Every time I get out they put me right back in
The Michael Corleone of the microphone
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems
I gather no moss like a rolling stone
Case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon

(C'mon) It's the Roc [3X]
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)

[Lenny Kravitz: repeat 2X]
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes
Some get left behind, some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

[Jay-Z]
Tote, more Guns then Roses, foes is, visibly shook of the invisible book, let's go
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain
And in order to experience joy you need pain
Every time a baby is born, somebody slain
You know the saying, somebody's loss is another's gain
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain
A rainbow then the cloud comes out we do it again
Everything evens up, you just wait
Even a garbage can gets a steak
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith
But when it turns your way before it turns away
To turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay
You will get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go

(C'mon) It's the Roc [3X]
(C'mon) That's right (C'mon)

[Lenny Kravitz: repeat 2X]
Life is all about Guns and Roses
Bittersweet like friends and foes
Some get left behind, some get chosen
Just like life, Guns and Roses

Life is all about Guns and Roses
