"Friend Or Foe" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"Friend Or Foe"



Check one check two, you know what to do
Primo, cold crush when I give it to you
Friend or foe yo, state your biz
Ya tend to dough, ah, there it is
Me, I run the show, oh, and these kids
Don't like nobody commin around here fuckin wit they doe for shit
You enterprisin though,
And I like it
But fuck with the big dogs though, I gotta bite ya,
Look, its out of my hands
And you gettin money round here, its not in the plans
So hop yo ass out of that van, head back to kansas
I'm sendin niggas back up in campuses
Chance is slimmer than that chick in calvin klien pantses
Let me guess, they said it was money round here
And the rest is me stoppin you from gettin it, correct?
Sorry to hear that, my guess is you got work at the hotel
I'll take care of that, you'll see, now please
Give me the room key
You're twitchin, don't do that, you makin me nervous
My crew, well, they do pack, them niggas is murderous
So would ya, please put your hand back in sight
They don't like to see me nervous you can understand that, right?
You draw, better be picasso, y'know the best
Cause if this is not so, ah, god bless
You leave me no choice, I leave you no voice
Believe me son I hate to do it just as bad as you hate to see it done 
Now calm your boys, 
Cause I'm findin it a little hard to concentrate with all the noise
Get the point, I'll let ya go, 
Before ya leave, I guess I aughta let you know, I need those keys
And promise you never, no matter the weather
Evaevaevaevaevaevaevaevaeva come around here no mo'
