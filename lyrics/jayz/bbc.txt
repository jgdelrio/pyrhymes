"BBC" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"BBC"



Let's work [x4]

D boy drug dealer look
Billionaire, billionaire

From the cocoa leafs to the farmers
To the polo fleece to the bombers
R.I.P. to Gianni
Now we on our way
D boy drug dealer look
Billionaire

Let's work

[Verse 1]
Bally shoes, Gucci sneakers
Pharrell's a pharaoh, peep the features
Unlaced Adidas
Top of the world like pyramids in Giza
Fila sweats, 88 I rocked a mock neck
Carried a nine in my projects
Bucket hat EPMD cassettes
Now I'm smoking loud in Ibiza
Mix the D'USSE with the reefer
My whole life is leisure
Gangsta lean like the Pisa
Eiffel Tower, Hermes towel
The Feds perched like an owl
Real niggas all feel the hook

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2]
What you know about going out, head west
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in the headrest
Mase niggas at Madison Square Garden
20 million sold and we still catching charges
Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekicks Suzuki Jeeps and Cherokees
Hoop earrings
Coupes with the rear cameras
Put that bitch in a cherry M3
I'm not ya average dope dealer
Silver Toyotas four runners and four wheelers
Me and Teflon Q45 infinite
Windows tinted
White girl all up in it
Britney, bitch
MCM seats buck 50 stitch
Versace plates got the Basquiat
Collab from Versace place
Cuban link 5 kilo
You life is illegal
When your chain can get the RICO
Real niggas all feel the hook

[Chorus x2]
