"Beach Is Better" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"Beach Is Better"



Get ya ass on the celly
Cause I ain't got time
To be arguing with your ass
If you ain't really ready

Girl why you never ready
For as long as you took
You better look like Halle Berry
Or Beyonc√®. Shit then we getting married

I brought sand to the beach
Cause my beach is better
You can keep ya beach
Cause that beach whatever

Started out at The Darby
Ended up at 1 Oak
Left the house with 100 grand
Ended up near broke

Don't get mad at me
I'm buying bucket after bucket
When it's gone I'm like fuck it
I replace it with another one

Can't take this money with you
Burn this shit up like I'm richer
Nigga's asking
If the oven's on
