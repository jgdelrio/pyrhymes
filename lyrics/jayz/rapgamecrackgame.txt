Jay-Z Lyrics




"Rap Game / Crack Game"



Uhh...
Uhh, yeah
Won't stop niggaz
"Somehow the rap game remind me of the crack game" - [Nas]
Jigga! Feel me
People, told ya motherfuckers, told ya
"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke" - [OutKast]
Uhh, Roc-a-Fella
Geyeah

We treat this rap shit just like, handlin weight
What they want we give it to em, what they abandon we take
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio
Let em test the product, give em a promo show
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe
Then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five
Ain't tryin to, kill em at first just, buildin clientele
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo
You don't want no garbage papi it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'

"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" - [Nas]
"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke" - [OutKast]
[repeat 3X]

Ge-ge-geyeah
I got that uncut raw to make a fiend's body jerk
Got your whole block now, pumpin my work
My CD's is like keys for you Willie's who
like to floss my cassette tapes in sixty-two's
And my singles like gems, you know the treys
Get you high for a while, but the, high don't stay
You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks
Cause when this shit flip, I'ma get on some other shit
Never pitchin for a label, Jigga's the hook-up
You know my shit is fish scale, y'all niggaz is cook up
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key
Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories
Now I'm the new nigga, who figured I'd get the game locked
Now watch how the prices of your cocaine drop, ha ha

"Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game" - [Nas]
"See that rap shit is really just like sellin smoke" - [OutKast]
[repeat 4X]
