"Anything" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"Anything"
(feat. Usher, Pharrell)



[Chorus Usher & Pharrell]

Anything you want girl
I'll bet you never seen it like this
Just stay up on that floor girl
And I'll grant all your wishes
You know, you know, you know,
You know, you know, you know,
You hot
Especially when you bounce, bounce
I really like it when you bounce, bounce

[Verse One]

Ooh you so nasty
Amateur pole dancing
Come and get this cash from me
They call me rain man
She tried to rain dance
Money so long it will drown you girl
Buried under so much stacks
They had to pull back about 50 thou
Before they found ya girl
I brought book bags of that bankroll
I'm a D boy baby they know
I'm an original D boy
They go bankrupt if they try to keep up
No roof in my car but I got mirrors on the ceiling
I'll spread bread on the bed
Ever had sex on a million
Tell me

[Chorus]

[Verse Two]

Red light, TLC
Through the left eye
My POV
On the eye chat
How's that for computer love
She rolled her eyes back
I'm like ooh you're so nasty
You turned my Maybach back seat
Into the Hotel De'Paris
I ain't gotta go
Down to the go-go
You got a private show that's like magic city
I got stacks of fifties
I got piles of hundreds
That's role play
Act like you want it
You know you know you hot like fire
You throw that body
I'll throw them dollars
But not them 1's and not no 5's
Have you ever seen a Grover Cleveland?
That's a thousand dollars

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]

Girl
You know
You hot like fire
As I blow some dough
You might retire
Take it slow like Ne-Yo
When shots was fired
In the Matrix have patience
Got lots of bottles
Rock-a-bye baby JAY-Z got notes like Mariah
Got no 1's got no 5's
My D notes are higher
I'm a D boy, they decoys
They money is lighter
Like Nicole Richie
Roll with me
They on the diet baby

[Chorus 2x]
