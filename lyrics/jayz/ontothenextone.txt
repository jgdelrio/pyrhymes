Jay-Z Lyrics




"On To The Next One"
(feat. Swizz Beatz)



[Swizz Beats:]
I got a million ways to get it
Choose one (choose one)
Hey, bring it back (bring it back)
Now double your money and make a stack

I'm on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one

Hold up, freeze

Somebody bring me back some money please

[Jay-Z:]
Hov on that new shit niggas like how come
Niggas want my old shit, buy my old album
Niggas stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it moving
Niggas make the same shit, me I make the blueprint

Came in the Range, hopped out the Lexus
Every year since I've been on that next shit
Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes
Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records

Used to rock a throwback, balling on the corner
Now I rock a tailored suit looking like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas brother I'm a grown up
No I'm not a virgin I use my kahonas

I move onward the only direction
Can't be scared to fail in the search of perfection
Gotta keep it fresh even when we sexing
But don't be mad at him when he's on to the next one

Freeze

Somebody bring me back some money please!

[Swizz Beats:]
I got a million ways to get it
Choose one (choose one)
Hey, bring it back (bring it back)
Now double your money and make a stack

I'm on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one

Hold up
Freeze!
Somebody bring me back some money please!

Fuck a throwback jersey 'cause we on to the next one
And fuck that auto-tune 'cause we own
And niggas don't be mad 'cause it's all about progression
Loiterers should be arrested, I used to drink Cristal
Them fuckers racist, so I switched Gold Bottles on to that spade shit
You gon' have another drink or you just gon' babysit
On to the next one, somebody call the waitress
Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I don't get dropped, I dropped the label
World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen
Niggas in the same spot, me I'm dodging rain drops
Meaning I'm on vacay, chilling on a big yacht
Yeah I got on flip flops, white Louie boat shoes
You should grow the fuck up
Come here let me coach you

Hold up
Freeze!
Somebody bring me back some money please!

[Swizz Beats:]
I got a million ways to get it
Choose one (choose one)
Hey, bring it back (bring it back)
Now double your money and make a stack

I'm on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one

Freeze!
Somebody bring me back some money please!

Uh, Big pimping in the house now
Bought the land, tore the motherfucking house down
Bought the car, tore the motherfucking roof off
Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the motherfucking doors off
Foot out that bitch about to shit like a skateboard
Navigation on trying to find my next thrill
Feeling myself I don't even need an x pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uh, I don't know why they really worry bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chilling in the projects
Had her out in Bed Stuy chilling on the steps
Drinking quarter waters gotta be the best
MJ at summer jam, Obama on the text
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gonna do next

Hold up
Freeze!
Somebody bring me back some money please!

[Swizz Beats:]
I got a million ways to get it
Choose one (choose one)
Hey, bring it back (bring it back)
Now double your money and make a stack

I'm on to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one
On to the next one

Hold up
Freeze!
Somebody bring me back some money please!
