"Lucifer" lyrics

Jay-Z Lyrics




"Lucifer"



Lucifer, son of the morning!
I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
Lucifer, Lucifer, son of the morning...
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, Lucifer, son of the morning!
I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(Kanyeezy you did it again, you're a genius nigga!)
Lucifer, Lucifer, son of the morning...
you niggas change your attitude
'Fore they asking what happened to you

Lord forgive him
He got them dark forces in him
But he also got a righteous cause for sinning
Them a murder me so I gotta murder them first
Emergency doctors performing procedures
Jesus
I ain't trying to be facetious
But "Vengeance is mine" said the Lord
You said it better than all
Leave niggas on death's door
Breathing off respirators
for killing my best boy, haters
On permanent hiatus as I skate
In the Maybach Benz
Flyer the Sanaa Lathan
Pumping "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo
In Los Angeles
Like an evangelist
I can introduce you to your maker
Bring you closer to nature
Ashes after they cremate you bastards
Hope you been reading your psalms and chapters
Paying your tithes being good Catholics
I'm coming

Lucifer, son of the morning!
I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
Lucifer, Lucifer, son of the morning...
(I'm from the murder capital, where we murder for capital)
Lucifer, Lucifer, son of the morning!
I'm gonna chase you out of Earth
(Kanyeeze you did it again, you're a genius nigga!)
Lucifer, Lucifer, son of the morning...
you niggas change your attitude
'Fore they asking what happened to you

Yes
This is holy war
I wet you all with the holy water
Spray from the Heckler Koch automatic
all the static shall cease to exist
Like a sabbatical I throw a couple at you
Take six
Spread love to all of my dead thugs
I'll pour out a little Louie 'til I head above
Yes sir
And when I perish
The meek shall inherit the earth
Until that time it's on and popping church
Like Don Bishop
The fifth upon cock either
Lift up your soul or give the holy ghost please
I leave ya in somebody's cathedral
And stunting like Evel Knievel
I'll let you see where that bright light lead you
The more you talk the more you irking us
The more you gonna need memorial services
The Black Album's second verse is like
Devil's pie please save some dessert for us

Man I gotta get my soul right
I gotta get these devils out my life
These cowards gonna make a nigga ride
They won't be happy 'til somebody dies

Man I gotta get my soul right
'Fore I'm locked up for my whole life
Every time it seems it's alright
Somebody want they soul to rise
(I'll chase you off of this Earth)

I got dreams of holding a Nine milla
To Bob's killer
Asking him "Why?" as my eyes fill up
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow
Gone but not forgotten homes I still feel ya
So... curse the day that birthed the bastard
Who caused your church mass
Reverse the crash
Reverse the blast
And reverse the car
Reverse the day, and there you are
Bobalob
Lord forgive him we all have sinned
But Bob's a good dude please let him in
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge
Please blame it on the son of the morning
Thanks again
