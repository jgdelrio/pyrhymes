Jay-Z Lyrics




"I Know What Girls Like"
(feat. Lil' Kim, Puff Daddy)



[Verse One: Jay-Z]
Peep the scripts
Gold honey from the whips
Jumped out like YO! 
Who the fuck you with
Flash the juice 'cause that's the rule
Damn I like a girl who spend a little cash for her shoes ***
Natural - Can I get at you?
Saw a spot on the body look nice with a tattoo
With my name, but didn't want to jump the gun
I Didn't Know how many niggas was humping hon
I said I never seen a face like yours before
And I been around some cute whores before
That either me or my boys tore it up before
So I'm hoping you different 
Let you push the 6
And give you a different life and
Baby if it's right jump on it in the morning
And ride it 'til the night
Want to buy you real jury when it hits the light
Bitches are momentarily lose they sight
She said

[Chorus:]
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me

[Verse Two: Lil' Kim]
So want a cutie with a booty like OW!
Deeper than the MOW!
Airy Shine like TADOW!
But I'm a real bitch so you know I do real things
Only real bitches live like queens - Get it?
Safety deposit in the walk-in closet
Marvel Forts is for matching Rolls Royce's
In the driveway from Monday to Friday
I be the richest, shitting on these bitches
While chickens cluck giving up the butt
I blaze the cut with the daddy raw buff
You can call me a slut
Who gives a fuck
That's fine nigga shit
I'm a good with mine
I can tell by your shoes you know what I want
Fuck a prenup give me half up front
My sex be the best so we split these costs
You can stop saying mine
And start saying ours

[Chorus:]
I know what girls like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what girls like, girls like me

I know what boys like
I know what they want
They want to sex me
They think I'm sexy
I know what boys like, boys like me

[Verse Three: Jay-Z]
Got the bomb place, fireplace John Blaze
Victoria Secret lingerie
Ice like Don King 
The price was like 8 digits a long way, shit
Got the beachfront view
V1 too
Cop you one cop me one too
On the place, jetski's park by the lake
No neighbors, make all the noise you want to make
Invite your friends over
Better make their way through 
The Benz's and the Rovers before they reach the door
Vacate, hey wait, a week or more
First class to and fro, freakin off
Got the ham things lot
Champaigne popped
Cruise around the world 'til the damn thing stop
Cop rembrandt, handle, pay the lot
Can't complain, we balling, true or not?

[Chorus: 2x]
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like
I know what girls like
I know what they want
I know what girls like, girls like me

I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like
I know what boys like
I know what they want
I know what boys like, boys like me
