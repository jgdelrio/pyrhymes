Jay-Z Lyrics




"D.O.A. (Death Of Auto-Tune)"



[Chorus:]
Only rapper to re-write history without a pen
No ID on the track let the story begin, begin, begin

This is anti autotune, death of the ringtone,
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct
This might offend my political connects
My raps don't have melodies
This should make niggas wanna go and commit felonies
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn
I know we facing a recession
But the music y'all making going make it the great depression
All y'all lack aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set men
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of autotune, moment of silence

[Chorus]

This ain't a number one record
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon
I made this just for Flex and...
... Mister Cee, I want niggas to feel threatened
Stop your bloodclot crying
The kid, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
You niggas' jeans too tight
You colors too bright, your voice too light (too far nigga)
I might wear black for a year straight
I might bring back Versace shades
This ain't for z100
Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it a hundred
This is for Hot 97
This shit's for Clue, for Khaled, for we the best in
Nigga this shit violent
Death of autotune, moment of silence

[Chorus]

This shit need a verse from Jeezy
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Give this to a blood, let a crip walk on it
Fifty thou' to style on this
I just don't need nobody to smile on this
You niggas singing too much
Get back to rap you t-paining too much
I'm a multi-millionaire
So how is it I'm still the hardest nigga here
I don't be in the project hallway talking about how I be in the project all day
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta this is how you prove it to me
Nigga just get violent
This is death of autotune moment of silence
