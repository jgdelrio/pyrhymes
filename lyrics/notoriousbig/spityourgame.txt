Notorious B.I.G. Lyrics




"Spit Your Game"
(feat. Twista, Bone Thugs N Harmony)



Notorious

[B.I.G.:]
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat

Swizzie, Swizzie
Y'all ready? Y'all ready?
Where Brooklyn at? 
Hey, King of New York B.I.G., Twista, Bone

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

[B.I.G.:]
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us notorious, thug ass niggas that love to bust, it's strange to us
You all niggas be scrambling gambling, up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We're just sitting here trying to win, trying not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin, so much smoke need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins, nigga you should too if you knew what this game would do to you
Been in this shit since '92, look at all the bullshit I've been through
So called beef with you know who, fucked a few female stars or two
Then a blue light niggas knew like
Mike-shit not to be fucked with. Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit, fuck the luck shit strictly aim
No aspiration to quit the game

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip and hit the right one
Pass that weed I gotta light one

All them niggas I gotta fight one
All them hoes I gotta like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you wanna do? Fight or run?

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

Ladies and gentlemen, Twista

[Twista]
Making money livin' marvelous, in God we trust
Don't too many niggas wanna start with us, got big guns in the cars with us
Bust at any motherfucker acting hard with us
Don't really wanna show you what a G.I.B
I'd rather be sippin' Remy in V.I.P
When you hear the music it'll be by me, Twista with the legendary nigga B.I.G

Brooklyn and K-Town, when you checking out the flow, you know it's going rain with persistence
Two legends on the same track, two different plains of existence
Let's get it crackin' I love to bust flows
Hit it from the back 'cause I love to fuck whore
Spit it for the city I love Chicago, Calico's bumping, I love to bust dough
Jeesus

You think you can spit on the mic like you're Biggie and flow just as steady as I
Shit is real you know you love him
You ain't got "Ready to Die"
"Life After Death"
Give it to you, however you wanna nigga, that a day after, give it to you, however you wanna nigga

'Cause the shit it get deep
So I carry big heat
Screamin', "Come and get me!"
Twista and Biggie on the Swizz Beat (Swizzie)

Three mils I love to make one, all these cars I love to ride one
All these whores I love to cut one
A tribute to Big
I love to bust one

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

Them Bone boys is back!
Them Bone boys is back!
Let's go

[Bone Thugs N Harmony]
In the middle of it I'm 'a
Bring niggas more drama 
Than they baby mama
Nigga wanna battle I'm 'a bomb you
One man but attack like a pack of piranhas, like terracotta
Niggas always ready for the war, but they really don't wanna see a nigga though
We can hit 'em in a minute, then we finish with
The venom of the rhythm of a nigga with a sick-o-flow
Let's go

Doing it with Swizz, oh, no! You niggas is in trouble
Somebody better call po-po
It's gonna be murder when I get to serving them verbally (yeah)
And niggas you heard of me
Wig splitter
Killer nigga word to me
And I'm classic like Bird and Magic, with a tactic to snatch his rep back, and stack some platinum

Dumping on them at random
With the bullets I brand them
Fitting to hold the game ransom
Running up in your mansion
Cash demanding, flashing cannons
(Let's go)

Niggas ain't ready for this one
Come on
'Cause I'm on a mission to get even better believe it
I'm heavily heated
It's easy to see me
If you wanna see me let that be the reason
(C'mon, B.I.G.!)

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique
Spit your game, talk your shit, grab your gat, call your clique

Come on, come on, come on, come on

Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one
Squeeze your clip hit the right one
Pass that weed I got to light one

[Swizz Beatz and (Krayzie Bone):]
(Notorious! Notourious!)
You just heard the sounds of the King of New York
B.I.G. (B.I.G.)
There's only one crown
