[Bridge: Faith Evans]
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Yeeeeeeeeah, yeeeeeeeeeah!
So goooooood, so goooooood!
I loooove you sooooooo much!
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance...

[The Notorious B.I.G. {CJ Wallace}:]
{First things first! } I Poppa - freaks all the honies (uh-huh!)
Dummies! (uh!) - Playboy bunnies, those wantin' money!
Those the ones I like cause they don't get Nathan
But penetration - unless it smells like sanitation!
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs
Heartthrob? Never! - Black (uh!) and ugly as ever!
{However, I stay Coogi down to the socks}
{Rings and watch filled with rocks! } (uh!)
{And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi}
{Girls pee pee when they see me, Navajos creep me in they teepee! } (uh!)
{As I lay down laws like Alan Coppet.}
{Stop it! (uh!) - If you think you're gonna make a profit? }
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns! - Get it?
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it, then split it (uh!)
In two {as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A.}
{I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya! }
{I'm clockin' ya, Versace shade watchin' ya! }
{Once ya grin, I'm in, game begin! } (uh!)
{First I talk about how I dresses this}
{In diamond necklasses, stretch Lexuses! } (whooo!)
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper (uh!) help ya reach the! (uh!)
Climax that your man can't make,
("Call him, tell him you'll be home real late, now sing the break! Uhh! }

[Chorus 1: Faith Evans (CJ & Biggie)]
Baabyyyyyy, heeeeere I am (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Aaaaall, I neeeeed is ooooone, more chaaaaaance! One more chance...
IIIII can heeelp you fiiiiiind, yourseeeeelf! (I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Cause you, don't neeeeeed, noboooo-dy eeeeelse! - One more chaaaance... (remix)

[The Notorious B.I.G. {CJ Wallace}:]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz.
There I is! (uh!) {Major Payne like Damon Wayans! } (uh-huh!)
{Low Down, Dirty even, like his brother Keenan! }
Schemin'! (uh!) - Don't leave ya girl 'round me
True player for real {ask Puff Dad-dy! } (uh!)
You ringin bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel, uh!
{Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell! }
{She beeped me, meet me at twelve! }
Where you at? - Flippin' jobs, payin' car notes? (yeeeah!)
While I'm swimmin in ya women like the breast stroke! (uh-huh!)
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat! (uh-huh!)
Nuttin' left to do but send her home to you;
I'm through! - {Can ya sing the song for me, Boo? }

[Chorus 2: Faith Evans (CJ & Biggie) {CJ}]
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
{Uhh, what? Uhh... uhh, uhh! - Ya didn't know? Uhh! }
One more chaaaaaaance! - Biggie give me one more chaaaance!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
{Uhh, uhh, uhh... what? What?) One more chaaaaaaance...

[CJ Wallace (The Notorious B.I.G.):]
So, what's it gonna be, him or me? (uh!)
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls! (uh-huh!)
The envy of all women - crushed linen
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em. (whoooo!)
(Finest women I love with a passion!)
(Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin!)
(High fashion - flyin' into all states?)
(Sexin' me while ya man masturbates!)
(Isn't this great?) Your flight leaves at eight
(Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds, uh!)
Lyrically I'm supposed (uh!) to represent
I'm not only a client (what?) I'm the Player President! (uh!)

[Chorus 2: x1/2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro: Diddy (The Notorious B.I.G.)]
Bad Boy, Bad Boy!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
EastCoast, EastCoast...
WestCoast, WestCoast...
