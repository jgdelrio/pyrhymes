"Fuck You Tonight" lyrics

Notorious B.I.G. Lyrics




"Fuck You Tonight"
(feat. R. Kelly)



[Big] Uhh
[Dad] I like that, you like that? Heh
[Big] Here's another one
[Dad] And another one
[Big] And another one
[Dad] And another one
[Big] Uhh, what, what?

[Intro/Chorus: R. Kelly, Biggie (variations on Big's part)]
You must be used to me spending (uh, uh)
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight
Uh, Here's another one
And another one
Uh, uh, what

[Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.]
Some say the X, make the sex Spec-tacular
Make me lick you from yo' neck to your back, then ya
Shivering, tongue delivering
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's all right with you, we fuckin' (that's cool)
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin' in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs?
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head
Straight to your mother's bed
Not the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle
Now I know you're used to suites at the Parker Meridien
Trips to the Caribbean
But tonight, no ends

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]
Girl you look fine
Like a wide face Rolex, you just shine
I like that waistline
Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb
My style genuine, girl I love you long time
I got you pinned up, with your fuckin' limbs up
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up
Bitch keep yo' chin up, please watch me do thee
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mami
I like it when you tro' it pon me
No love makin', strictly back breakin'
Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more
So no, caviar, Shark Bar, uh-uh
Strictly sex that's sweaty and leftover spaghetti
I know you used to slow CD's and Dom P's
But tonight it's eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse Three: R. Kelly]
You must be used to me spending
(You must be, used to me)
And all that sweet wining and dining (spending all his money baby, on you)
Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
Can you feel me?, 'cause I can feel you
You must be used to me spending
You must be used to me
And all that sweet wining and dining
Well, I'm fuckin' you tonight
(fuckin' you tonight)
Can you feel me? (make ya feel so right),'cause I can feel you (baby come to me)
Can you feel me (give me what I need), R. Kelly take me to the bridge

Lets stop the bullshit baby
Let me take you to the spot, fit you hot
So you wanna be with me, Puff Daddy
B.I.G., bring that ass to me

[Chorus: repeat to fade with variations]
