Notorious B.I.G. Lyrics




"B.I.G. Interlude"



Yo
C-Gutta where you at?
D Rockafella
Caesar Leo Degenero
Bled C
Money SL
Uhh...

B.I.G. is making this cream
Bitches always say what the hell does that mean?
B is for the bitches, who can't understand
How one fly nigga became a man
I is for the way it goes in and out
One by one I knocks em out
G is for the way the game goes in the gutter
Other MC's man they ain't sayin nuthin
Rockin on, to the break of dawn
Make the bitch give the pussy get the mouth I'm gone

What?
It ain't no more to it
