"One More Chance (Remix)"
(feat. Faith Evans)
(from "Notorious" soundtrack)



[The Notorious B.I.G. (Diddy):]
Uh
What?
(That's right. That's right. Bad Boy!)
What? Uh!
Uh, uh!
Lyrically I'm, uh!
Uh, check it out!
Uh, lyrically I'm
Uh... uh, uh!
What?
Junior M.A.F.I.A.! (Remix)
Uh, Junior M.A.F.I.A.!

[Faith Evans in the background:]
Hmm! Yeah, yeah!
Don't go, don't go, don't go!
Baby don't go
I love you so much!
One more chance!
Biggie give me one more chance
One more chance!
One more chance!
Biggie give me one more chance
Give me a chance

[The Notorious B.I.G.:]
First things first, I poppa! - Freaks all the honies! (uh-huh!)
Dummies! (uh!) - Playboy bunnies, those wantin' money
Those the ones I like cause they don't get Nathan
But penetration, unless it smells like sanitation
Garbage, I turn like doorknobs
Heart throb? Never! - Black and ugly as ever!
However - I stay Coogi down to the socks
Rings and watch filled with rocks! (uh!)
And my jam knock in your Mitsubishi
Girls pee pee when they see me (uh-huh!)
Navajos creep me in they tee pee! (uh!)
As I lay down laws like Alan Kopit
Stop it! (uh!) - If you think they gonna make a profit!
Don't see my ones, don't see my guns! - Get it?
Now tell ya friends Poppa hit it (uh!) then split it!
In two as I flow with the Junior M.A.F.I.A. (uh!)
I don't know what the hell's stoppin' ya!
I'm clocking ya, Versace shades watchin' ya! (uh-huh!)
(Don't go, don't go, don't go!)
Once ya grin, I'm in, game begin! (uh!)
First I talk about how I dresses this
In diamond necklaces, stretch Lexuses! (whooo!)
(Oh baby baby)
The sex is just immaculate from the back I get
Deeper and deeper! - Help ya reach the (uh-huh!)
Climax that your man can't make
(come on come on baby)
Call him, tell him you'll be home real late, and sing the break! (uh!)

[Faith Evans (The Notorious B.I.G.) & ("Puff Daddy"):]
Baby, here I am
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
All I need is one more chance!
One more chance
I can help (uh!) you find yourself!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Cause you don't need (uh!) nobody else!
One more chance... (Remix!)

[The Notorious B.I.G. ("Puff Daddy"):]
She's sick of that song on how it's so long
Thought he worked his until I handled my biz
There I is! (uh!) - Major Payne like Damon Wayans (uh-huh!)
Low Down Dirty even like his brother Keenan
Schemin'! (uh!) - Don't leave ya girl round me
True player for real, ask Puff Dad-dy! ("yeah! ")
You ringin' bells with bags from Chanel
Baby Benz, traded in your Hyundai Excel. (uh!)
Fully equipped, CD changer with the cell (uh-huh!)
(Don't go, don't go, don't go!)
She beeped me, meet me at twelve! (uh!)
Where you at? Flippin' jobs, paying car notes? ("yeah! ")
While I'm swimmin' in ya women like the breast stroke! ("uh-huh! ")
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke
Death stroke - tongue all down her throat! (uh-huh!)
Nothing left to do but send her home to you
I'm through! - Can ya sing the song for me, boo?

[Faith Evans (The Notorious B.I.G.):]
One more chance!
One more chance!
Biggie give me one more chance!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Give me one more chance
One more chance!
Biggie give me one more chance!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
One more chance!
Biggie give me one more chance!

[The Notorious B.I.G. ("Puff Daddy"):]
So, what's it gonna be? - Him or me? (uh!)
We can cruise the world with pearls, gator boots for girls. (uh-huh!)
The envy of all women - crushed linen!
Cartier wrist-wear with diamonds in 'em. (woo!)
The finest women I love with a passion
Ya man's a wimp, I give that ass a good thrashin'!
High fashion - flyin' into all states (uh!)
Sexing me while ya man masturbates! ("uh, uh! ")
Isn't this great? Your flight leaves at eight
(Don't go, don't go, don't go!)
Her flight lands at nine, my game just rewinds. (uh!)
Lyrically I'm supposed to represent (what?)
I'm not only the client, I'm the player president! (uh!)

[Faith Evans (The Notorious B.I.G.):]
One more chance!
Biggie give me one more chance!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
One more chance!
One more chance!
All I need is one more chance
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie give me one more chance!
All I need is one more chance
Come on come on
One more chance!
I can help (uh!) you find yourself!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
Biggie give me one more chance!
I don't need nobody else
One more chance!

Biggie give me one more chance!

[Diddy (The Notorious B.I.G.):]
Bad boy, bad boy!
(I got that good love girl, you didn't know?)
