Notorious B.I.G. Lyrics




"Love Is Everlasting (Outro)"



[Biggie mom]
Lets say many times as i looked and soroow reflexes of my son (Biggie) i argue sometimes and saltied i soroow thoughts and said "Well Done" i thoght of
him (Biggie) instinly and slighty ask why i tried formly and just can`t say goodbye i live with visions twin and twisted passion so cold and withored
thoghts batored shattered i dream dreams cherish memory`s house friendships and promise that mattered in the end time is trausured like love for my son
Love Is Everlasting
