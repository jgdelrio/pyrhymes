Notorious B.I.G. Lyrics




"Playa Hater"



Good evening
And for my last hit
I'd like to take you back to the classic
A-hem, B.I.G. style of course
Uhh

[singing]
Playaahh, turn your head round
Lay on the ground, you've been robbed
Wake up, open the door
Lay on the floor, you've been robbed
Uhh
You know, we need this money
And you, yes baby, you, should just roll with me
Let's go off, together
On this robbin spree, we'll make money
Uhh
Playaahh, turn your head round
Take off that crown, you've been robbed
Wake up, open the door
Don't cry no more, you've been robbed

You see, there are two kind of people in the world today
We have, the playaz, and we have, the playa haters
Please don't hate me because I'm beautiful baby

Hear what they talk, about me
But my crew so deep, you can't do, a damn thing, to me

Playahh, open the door
Lay on the floor, you've been robbed
Wake up (wake your ass up), take off your jewels
You fuckin fools, you've been robbed (this is a robbery nigga)
Playahh playahh (hater), Playahh playahh (hater)
Playahh playahh (hater), Playahh playahh (hater)
Playahh hater!! (hater) Playahh hater!! (hater)
Playahh hater!! (hater) Playahh hater!! (hater)
Uhh, thank you... thank you very much *applause*
Thank you thank you far too kind, far too kind
Thank you, thank you very much
Good night everybody, good night!
I love all of you, thank you thank you
Thank you, thank you very much
Good night!
