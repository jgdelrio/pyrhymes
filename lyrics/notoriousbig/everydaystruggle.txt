Notorious B.I.G. Lyrics




"Everyday Struggle"



I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad Buddha abuser

But they don't know about the stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray
So you can reminisce and wish
You wasn't living so devilish shit

I remember I was just like you
Smoking blunts with my crew
Flipping oldies 62s
'Cause GED wasn't BIG, I got PAID
That's why my moms hate me

She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for twenty down south
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps trying to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't trying to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court for an assault
That I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand
'Cause man

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust
He like to ask who's next?
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon' to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant bitch got gassed
At last I'm literally lounging black,
Sitting back counting double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call
It couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated
Like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I've never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me blowing like a bubble
In the everyday struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't trying to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge I'mma mold her now
Trick a little dough buying young girls fringes
Dealing with the dope fiend binges
Seeing syringes in the veins
Hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breaking days on the set no sweat drunk off MoÃ«t
Can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when I dry bagging five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashing line
I had the first and the third
Rehearse that's my word
Thick in the game Ds knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no!
Even though they had me scared
Yo they got a eight I got a TEC with air holes

That's just how the shit go in the struggle motherfucker
Hah, come on, what you say?

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knocking at my front door
I'm living every day like a hustle
Another drug to juggle
Another day another struggle
