"Somebody's Gotta Die" lyrics

Notorious B.I.G. Lyrics




"Somebody's Gotta Die"



I'm sitting in the crib dreaming about Lear jets and coupes
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop
Oops!
I'm interrupted by a doorbell
3:52, who the hell
Is this?
I gets up quick
Cocks my shit
Stop the dogs from barking
Then proceed to walking
It's a face that I seen before
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor
Check it
I look deeper
I see blood up on his sneakers
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth
So I dip
Nigga, is you creeping or speaking?
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the Beacon
I opens up the door, pitiful
Is he in critical?
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal
'Cause I'm a criminal
Way before the rap shit
Bust the gat shit
Puff won't even know what happened,
If it's done smoothly
Silencers on the Uzi
Stash in the hooptie
My alibi, any cutie
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop
Head spinning, reminiscing 'bout my man C-Rock

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

Filling clips he explained our situation
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facing
Some kid named Jason
In a Honda station wagon
Was bragging
About how much loot and crack he stacking
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique
Small crew
'Round the time I was locked up with you
True indeed
But yo nigga let me proceed
Don't fill them clips too high
Give them bullets room to breathe
Damn where was I?
Yeah
Went outta town, blew the fuck up
D-Roc went home
And Jay got stuck the fuck up
Hit him twice
caught him right for the Persian white
Pistol whipped his kids
And taped up his wife
(niggas is trife)
He figured Rock, set em up, no question
Wet em up no less
Than 50 shots in his direction
How many shots?
Man nigga, I seen mad holes
What kinda gats?
Hecklers, Kochs, and Calicos
But fuck that
I know where all them niggas rest at
In the building hustling
And they don't be strapped
Supreme in black
Is downstairs, the engine running
Find a bag to put the guns in
And c'mon if you're coming

Somebody gotta die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody got to die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch
Somebody got to die
If I go, you got to go
Somebody gotta die
Let the gunshots blow
Somebody got to die
Nobody got to know
That I killed yo' ass in the mist, bitch

Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down
How it's gon' go down
Lay these niggas low-down
Slow down
Fuck all that planning shit
Run up in they cribs
And make them cats abandon ship
See niggas like you do ten-year bids
Miss the nigga they want
And murder innocent kids
Not I
One nigga's in my eye
That's Jason
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted
Revenge I'm tasting at the tip of my lips
I can't wait to fill my clip in his hips
Pass the chocolate
Thai
Sing ain't lie
There's Jason with his back to me
Talking to his faculty
I start to get a funny feeling
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealing
Scream his name out
("Ay yo, playboy!")
Squeezed six nothing shorter
Nigga turned around holding his daughter
