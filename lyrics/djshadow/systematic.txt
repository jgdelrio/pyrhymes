"Systematic" lyrics

DJ Shadow Lyrics




"Systematic"
(feat. Nas)
(from "Silicon Valley" soundtrack)



[Nas:]
The system will defeat itself
Nothing stays in a steady state It overheats and melts
It only feeds itself, the system
Yo I think it exists just because like a pit eats its pups eats its own litter up
The system's fucked, it's corrupt
As for its own survival, it's genocidal
No place and origin, no beginnin' cycle
Let's occupy our streets
It's crazy to think in the eighties
I wanted minks, and a Benz to listen to Michael
And Grand Puba, Maxwell to get cash while
I'm sippin' on drinks
And Nike sweatsuits and Gucci links
I'm like a Russian mob figure, I'm mad low
In the shadows, pick up the shadow
DJ Shadow, a rose and thrown blows
Can't see me, but Nas movin' the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses

Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm sayin'
Should make you feel is my new expression
Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm sayin'
Should make you feel is my new expression

Systematic
Systematic

I wish I was a arms dealer to sale illegal arms in the hood
No backup check, put cash in my palms and we good
Lack of respect, get you to fall where you stood
Mathematics is God's language, it's in my blood
Art, music, letters and numbers
I'm a vessel, I'm humble
Meetin' start ups, I invest if I want to
Transformin' global markets with all of my partners
Methodical corporate culture, straight out the projects
What's the ingredients to the realest?
Place two cups of cranberry in the skillet
A half a cup of water, add some Henny
Let it cook for eight minutes, but you ain't finished
Let it simmer to the cranberry pop a little
Keep stirrin', sip it, it's art like Keith Haring
It gets in your blood, you start to feel what I'm feelin'
Don't listen, just try to feel what I'm feelin'

Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm sayin'
Should make you feel is my new expression
Hold your breath for fifteen seconds
Close your eyes, cover your ears, do not listen
Try to feel what I'm sayin'
Should make you feel is my new expression

Systematic, uh
Systematic

The world first
Remember the past?
Cherish the present and work for tomorrow
Time is now
Time-time, time-time, time-time, time-time, time-time
Time-time is now
Wooh!
