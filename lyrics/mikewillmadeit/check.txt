"Check" lyrics

Mike WiLL Made-It, Nas & Rick Ross Lyrics




"Check"
(from "Creed II: The Album" soundtrack)



[Intro:]
Mike Williams
Renzel Ravioli
Uh
This come country western shit, right?
Like Quentin Tarantino
Maybach Music

[Nas:]
Yo, you ain't standing on your words
You lose respect
Man up, check
Chest out, check
Chin up, check
Discipline, check
Listening, check

Picture what your opponent is thinking inside the square
This is like chess, strategize in the ring
He trying to be a father
But he lost his father to the same thing, check
Walking on blood stained ground
Gladiator school, America
So you ain't raised no fool
Catch this fade, is you brave?
Try to know what to expect out here
Fought every fight, what's left is the fight or death out here
Try to take my last breath, my air
Had to check my fear, that's why they respect Nasir
Feel me, you all witnessing what you never seen
Needing nothing attracts everything
The resurrection of the king

Man up, check
Chest out, check
Chin up, check
Discipline, check
Listening, check
Check

Man up, check
Chest out, check
Chin up, check
Discipline, check
Listening, check
My nigga, let your nuts hang
Check

[Rick Ross:]
Dark denim jeans, boots for the winter breeze
Never on the wiretaps let's give them something they can see
Born to be a boss so nail me to the holy cross
Life is a lesson, bless a nigga with a fortune
Speak with respect, seats to the Mets
We came from the streets
You just some geeks with a check
Cuban links swing like a leech from my neck
Make a mural of my face when I'm deceased with the best
Balenciaga sneaks, Balenciaga socks
Dark-skinned nigga but the brightest in the spot
Dreaming of the top, or I mighta signed with Koch
Carol city nigga, move a mountain with a block
Virgil in the white, murdered over kite
Wholesale prices like it's FashionNova site
Doubled up the shows, then I tax them for the flights
I'm mold by the code, so don't make me ask you twice

[Nas:]
Man up, check
Chest out, check
Chin up, check
Discipline, check
Listening, check
Check

Man up, check
Chest out, check
Chin up, check
Discipline, check
Listening, check
My nigga, let your nuts hang
Check

My nigga, let your nuts hang
My nigga, let your
My nigga, let your nuts hang
My nigga, let your
Nuts hang
My nigga, let your
My nigga, let your
My nigga, let your
Nuts hang
My nigga, let your
