"Coming Home" lyrics

Pusha T & Ms. Lauryn Hill Lyrics




"Coming Home"



Uh, ah fuck it, we all poor
Even if you got money, still looking for more
Why am I buying Rollies? I got twenty for sure
Still connect with you, a steel hid in the drawer
With no J's on I'm still looking to score
You see they gave us crack, then started waging a war
Uh, all theses lies, they steady telling me
Before Obama we had Eric B (Woah)
Or Tony Lewis out in D.C
The 80's kingpins gotta free them
All these faces they ain't believe in
If no child is left then how could we leave them?

When love is gone, you'll hold on to anything
Some do wrong, just to feel anything
But when the void is filled, you'll stand up to anything
When love is real, you can do anything

Uh, I do it for my big Benz drivers (Drivers)
For my street corner survivors (Survivors)
For my niggas that miss The Wire (Woah)
And throwback mami's that won't retire
Reminiscing on the days when the trips was Cancun 
And the bottles got sprayed
You can't relate 'cause you wasn't there
Naw, you wasn't hot, let me make it clear
Y'all was breaking into cars, we was Breaking Bad
When y'all was fighting dogs, we was racing Jags
This the life for the fast, ain't no future 
Ain't no past, we won't worry 'bout the crash, uh
Now it's jail poses and club pictures
Airbrushed back-drops and jail visits
This the dope boy song for the dope boy's gone 
Let 'em know it's still snowing

When love's withdrawn, you'll hold on to anything
Some do wrong, they have to do anything
But when the void is filled, you'll stand up to anything
When love is real, you can do anything

I'm speaking to the soul of my black native bros
Who ain't get to go to school like a J.Cole
Who ain't have a silver spoon or a bankroll
Who won't talk the golden rule but they made do
Free lunches and apple juices, uh
Food stamps, ashamed to use them
You ever lived with a user, shared a bed with abusers?
That's the worst way to lose them

I see the plan but it's a new day
Black people past their due day
Setting the captives free in a new way
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
It's a new day, black people past their due day
Setting the captives free in a new way
Said it's not over, it's not over
Yes, it's just started, it's just started

When love is strong, you can do anything
Things go wrong, but you'll stand up to anything
'Cause when the void is filled, you can do anything
When love is real, you can do anything
