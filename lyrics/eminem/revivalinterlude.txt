"Revival (Interlude)" lyrics

Eminem Lyrics




"Revival (Interlude)"



I've drowned in high from the ashes now
I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of every single grasp but ends of what's left over
And the lights in every broken blown out window screaming, laughing
I love to feel the course hang out
This is our revival
