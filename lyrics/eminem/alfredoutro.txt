"Alfred (Outro)" lyrics

Eminem Lyrics




"Alfred (Outro)"



This concludes our danse macabre
Portions of the proceeding were recorded
As for the rest of it, I'm very much afraid it was all in your mind
I don't intend to indulge in any post-mortem
If you haven't been murdered, I can only say
Better luck next time
If you have been, goodnight wherever you are
