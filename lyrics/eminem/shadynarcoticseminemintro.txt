Eminem Lyrics




"Shady Narcotics (Eminem Intro)"



Yeah!
God damn!
Feels like a long time don't it?
Did you miss us?
We missed you!

Shady Narcotics
It's the Re up!
Pussies

And we're back
Myself [gunshot]
D12 [gunshot]
50 cent [gunshot]
Obie Trice [gunshot]
Stat Quo [gunshot]

And I would also like to introduce. . .
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek [gunshot]
The other goes by the name of Ca$his [gunshot], from orange county
