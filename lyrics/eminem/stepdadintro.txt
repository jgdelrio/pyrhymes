Eminem Lyrics




"Stepdad (Intro)"



Get up
Dad, what?
What'd I fuckin' tell you about turnin' off the lights? (What, what? I didn't do it)
Don't fuckin' lie to me, I told you fuckin' don't touch, turn the fuckin' lights off
(Stop, I didn't do it)
Don't you fuckin' lie, you little fucker (No, ah, ah)
Don't you fuckin' lie to me (Stop)
