"Mr. Mathers (Skit)"



Mr. Mathers... Mr. Mathers can you hear my voice? OK he's not responding
I'm gonna need an 18 gauge left AC right away Uh, BP is 90 over 12, respiration's at 8
OK I'm tubing him DMC this is medic 41  Medic 41, this is DMC base, go ahead
He's cold, spike him back and grab the back board 
OK, got it, on 3... 1, 2, 3 Hu-let's move...
