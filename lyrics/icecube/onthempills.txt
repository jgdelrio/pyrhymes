"On Them Pills"



Now where's the [?] at?
He should be too embarrassed to even walk back through this mother fucker
When he-when he comes down, [?]
It can't be that fuckin' crazy to come outside and do some shit like this
He's off some [?] shit

Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals
Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals

Uh, you's a drugstore cowboy
Everything you put in your mouth look like a Altoid
Crazy ass niggas love a bitch named Molly
Passed out on the floor, go and get a dolly
I saw your boy-boy in the street butt naked
Wormin' up and down 122nd
His momma tried to stop him and those youngers had to mob 'em so cops tried to pop 'em but them bullets couldn't drop 'em
Damn

Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals
Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals

Baby, if you feelin' horny, take two of these and wake up in the mornin'
With a nigga snorin', you don't even know
And his half cousin and his little bro
Damn, are you a hoe from Idaho?
Hell yeah, especially off that chemical
Them fuckin' drugs'll take you that pinnacle
Drop you in the snow with it ten below

Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals
Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals

He [?] and got them Oxycontin
Got them front teeth all rotten
Viagra mixed with ecstasy is the reason for your latest pregnancy
You the Joker off that Heath Ledger
I'ma smoker her (why?) 'cause weed's better
You niggas start to panic when you off that Xanax
Drownin' in the gutter, you think it's the Atlantic

Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals
Them niggas on them pills
Them bitches on them pills
Poppin' shit is why they can't pay they bills
They be sweatin', they need gills
Fuck that chronic smoke, they want them chemicals

My name is Jesus Christ, I just discovered that today
My name is Jesus Christ and I did not-yes, I asked for this
I was a thirsty bitch and I made a deal with the devil, sir
But I'm gonna hit a lick, okay?
Do you believe in Jesus Christ?
You do?
Do you believe in me?
Yeah? I won't let you in then, bitch
'Cause I joined the other side
I joined the other side!
[?] gasolina!
[?] gasolina!
Do you believe me now?
No
