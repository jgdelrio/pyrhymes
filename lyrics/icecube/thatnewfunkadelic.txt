Ice Cube Lyrics




"That New Funkadelic"



California

You know the beat so sweet like booty meat
(So sweet)
You know the beat so sweet like booty meat
(Like booty meat)
You know the beat so sweet like booty meat
You know the beat so sweet like booty meat
No matter who you meet, you can move your feet

Come through bumpin' that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Come through bumpin' that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Ice Cube got that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Ice Cube got that new Funkadelic
Better run, go tell it

Got an uncle named George
Only motherfucker always down to org'
Freaky motherfucker wanna Georgy-porge
Treat a big booty like a smorgasbord
Freaks on the flow, freaks on the flow
How many of y'all freaks on the low?
Freaks on the flow, freaks on the flow
How many of y'all freaks on the low?

What's up for the evening?
I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'
What's up for the evening?
I ain't into trickin' bitch, I'm into treatin'
What's up for the evening?
I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'
What's up for the evening?
I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'

You know all about that party life
Party life
All about that party life
Party life
All about that party life
Party life
All about that party life
Party life

Come through bumpin' that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Come through bumpin' that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Ice Cube got that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Ice Cube got that new Funkadelic
Better run, go tell it

I heard weed was legal
Grow that shit nigga, feed your people
I heard weed was legal
Grow that shit nigga, feed your people
I heard weed was legal
Grow that shit nigga, feed your people
I heard weed was legal
Grow that shit nigga, feed your people, c'mon

Let's make a toast to every lazy
(Throw one up for the whole wide world)
(It's a west-side celebration)
(No doubt about us, then you freaky, freaky yeah)

You know the funk will linger
All these motherfuckers wanna smell my finger
All these motherfuckers wanna fuck my singers
I don't give a damn nigga, Jerry Springer
California love, California blood
Long as I got it I don't give a fuck
It's the hypnotic, I'm the narcotic
So if you're spotted actin' robotic
Freeze just like a mannequin
And then start panicking
I'm too hard for you
They still wanna feed you like barbecue
Freaks on the flow, freaks on the flow
How many of y'all freaks on the low?
Freaks on the flow, freaks on the flow
How many of y'all freaks on the low?

Come through bumpin' that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Come through bumpin' that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Ice Cube got that new Funkadelic
That new Funkadelic
Ice Cube got that new Funkadelic
Better run, go tell it

I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'
What's up for the evening?
I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'
What's up for the evening?
I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'
What's up for the evening?
I ain't into trickin', I'm into treatin'
What's up for the evening?

You know the beats so sweet like booty meat
(Like booty meat)
You know the beats so sweet like booty meat
You know the beats so sweet like booty meat
No matter who you meet, you can move your feet
