Ice Cube Lyrics




"Super OG (Intro)"



Everything's corrupt
Everything's fucked up
Everything's 'bout a buck, we shit outta luck, yeah
Blood used to be thicker than water
Now it depends on what kinda water you talkin' about
Niggas'll kill they momma over that almighty dollar
Yeah, you know me, Super O-G
Always down to take a knee

Ice Cube Lyrics



album: "Everythang's Corrupt" (2018)
Super OG (Intro)
Arrest The President
Chase Down The Bully
Don't Bring Me No Bag
Bad Dope
On Them Pills
Fire Water
Streets Shed Tears
Ain't Got No Haters
Can You Dig It?
That New Funkadelic
One For The Money
Still In The Kitchen
Non Believers
Everythang's Corrupt
Good Cop Bad Cop
