Ice Cube Lyrics




"Robin Lench (Interlude)"



Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I'm Robin Lench! [applause]
And welcome to "The Lifestyles Of The Poor And Unfortunate"
where you and your broad can win 8 days and 9 dangerous nights at…
"The Come On In Motel" overviewing the Watts Tower. Ooooooooooooh!

And for your transportation pleasures, you get to ride on what?
The "R.T.D.": the "Rough, Tough and Dangerous"
where we provide you and your bitch round trip transfer
STRAIGHT DOWN GAGE!! [5 shots] (AYO, NIGGA! GET OUTTA THE CAR, NIGGA!)
where you get to meet who? O.G. Mac Bone! (who the fuck are?)
Hello, O.G. Mac Bone! Say: "Hi!" (NIGGA, FUCK YOU MUTHAFUCKA! (GET OUTTA HERE) SUCK ON THESE NUTS, PUNK!) [7 shots]

And for your gambling cravings, you can lose that trick-bitch that's with ya…almost well, basically...ANYWHERE!
(I give you $20 for your biiiiitch! Hahahahah!)

And for your nightlife entertainment, you get to visit our very own "Strawberry Showgirls"! Located where? On Figueroa!
'Ey, 'ey, bitch! 'Ey, how much for head?
Hahahahahah! Oww...ah-ah...
Oh! Until next time, 40 oz. dreams and watermelon wishes!
I'm Robin Lench!
Peace! 5000 G!
