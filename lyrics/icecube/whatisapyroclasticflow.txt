Ice Cube Lyrics




"What Is A Pyroclastic Flow?"
(feat. Keith David)



[Keith David]
What's the definition of a pyroclastic flow?
That's what happens when a volcano blow
That's what happens when Ice Cube starts to flow
Red hot lava mixed with salava
Pulvarising everything in it's wake
Nothing can survive a pyroclastic flow
And noone will survive this one
