"Wicked" lyrics

Ice Cube Lyrics




"Wicked"



[Intro: (some 'dreadhead', won't translate to avoid offending)]

[Verse 1:]

One, two, three and I come with the wicked
style and you know that I'm from the wicked
crew, act like you knew
cos I got everybody jumpin to the voodoo
Pick it, wicked rhymes, picket signs
While me and the mob gotta truck full of 9's]
