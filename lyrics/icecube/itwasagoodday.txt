Ice Cube Lyrics




"It Was A Good Day"



Break 'em
Shit
Yo
Yo, uh

Just waking up in the morning gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And mamma cooked a breakfast with no hog (damn)

I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
What's up?
Hooked it up for later as I hit the do'
Thinking will I live another twenty-four

I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Looking in my mirror and not a jacker in sight

And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm aksing y'all
Which park are y'all playing basketball?

Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple double
Freaking niggaz every way like M.J
I can't believe, today was a good day 
shit!

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me

No flexing, didn't even look in a nigga's direction
as I ran the intersection
Went to $hort Dog's house, they was watching Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?

Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggaz and watch me break 'em
with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven
Seven even back do' Lil' Joe

I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yelling domino
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day 
shit!

Left my nigga's house paid 
what?
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics

I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy, and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep

Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coasting
Took another sip of the potion
hit the three-wheel motion

I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashing those high beams

No helicopter looking for a murder 
Two in the morning got the Fatburger 
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read "Ice Cube's a pimp" 

Drunk as hell but no throwing up 
Half way home and my pager still blowing up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day 
shit!

Hey wait, wait a minute Pooh. Stop this shit
What the fuck I'm thinking about?
