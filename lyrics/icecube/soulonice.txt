Ice Cube Lyrics




"Soul On Ice"



[Intro:]
Internationally Known
You Got To Smell My Cologne
Westcoast Motherfucka
Let's Toast Motherfucka
Old Money [x16]

[Verse 1:]
Old Money New Money No Money Noge Money
Don't Try To Con The Godfather In Sunny
Don't Try To Turn Your Four Fathers Into Moneey
The Rap God Got the Whole World Praying For Me
Pray For Me Bird I See You LayingFor Me
Got Crazy Goons DJing For Me
I'm The Real Iron Man You Just Robert Downey
A Crack Head And Black Face Fresh Out The County
Nigga

[Chorus:]
Back The Fuck Up Off Me
I Burn Just Like Hot Coffee
I'm Conned Up Sweet Like Coffee
Look What This Game Done For Me
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Ey
You Bout To Smell My Cologne
You Bout To Smell My Cologne
You Bout To Smell My Cologne
Look Nigga
You Bout To Smell My Cologne

Old Money [x16]

[Verse 2:]
Candy Paint Flow Ever Since My Adidas
Ice Cube Fans Get Sugar Doc Ridas
Sugar Ray Leonard Style Nigga I'm The Sweetest
Roll In On Some Ass Just Like Jesus
Cool As A Fridge and You Shaking Like Jello
Mad Cause My LIfes Like A Marshmellow
Look Motherfucka If You Smell My Cologne
Ask Yourself Why You're All Up In My Zone

[Chorus:]
Back The Fuck Up Off Me
I Burn Just Like Hot Coffee
I'm Conned Up Sweet Like Coffee
Look What This Game Done For Me
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Look Mama Look Mama I'm Soul On Ice
Ey
You Bout To Smell My Cologne
You Bout To Smell My Cologne

Oooh Ooh Oh Ooh [x4]

[Outro:]
Yo What's Up My Niggas Out There
Just Letting You Know Right Now Man
You Got To You Better You Gotta Pay Your Dues
To The Dime Nigga
Dead On The Block And Hit Ya'll Ass
With That Old Ice Cube Superbom Hit
The One That Sent Your Cousin Tony Tole To The Peneteniary
Get Back In 89
The One That Sent Lil Ray Ray Out From LA
To St Louis And Got Off The Bus
And Served Those Nigga Them Quater Thangs
Make Sure Ya'll Tune Into Ice Cube
The First One Who Put You Niggas
On Burns And Pimping
Pistols And Preaching
On Burns And Pimping
Pistols And Preaching
On Burns And Pimping
Pistols And Preaching
On Burns And Pimping
Pistols And Preaching
Old Money [x16]
