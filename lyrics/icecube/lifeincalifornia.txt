Ice Cube Lyrics




"Life In California"
(feat. Jayo Felony, WC & Young Maylay)



[Chorus: Jayo Felony (Ice Cube)]
Living Just Another Day
AK Gun Play
LA To The Bay
Living Life In California

Dough We Get That Dough
Ooh We Got To Get More
Living Just Another Day
(Just Another Day)
AK Gun Play
(Ak Gun Play)
LA To The Bay
(LA To The Bay)
Living Life In California

[Verse 1: Ice Cube]
And Jay-Z Can Rap About The NYC
Why Can't I Talk About The Shit I See?
Without Alicia Keys Withouyt Going R&B
This Is Ain't No Motown This is R A P

[Hook: Jayo Felony]
It's A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood Yea
He Can't Stay If His Name Ain't There
All The Way From The Bay To A Night In [? ]
THis Is How It Is When You're Living In California

[Verse 2: Ice Cube]
California Swagger Fuck Record Sales
Industry Outlaw Like Josie Wales
California Off The Corner
I'm a Warn Ya I'm the Only West Coast King
Idiot I Mean I'll Get You In The Ring
I'm As Shitty As Don King
And Taking All The Money Before The Bell Ring
Before I Grab The Mic The Fat Bitch Sing
It's Already Over Supernova
I'm Kobe You A Nigga I'm Hooping Over
Know Me Big Homie
The One And Only
Ice Cube Don't Get Airplay
Cause I'm From LA And Rep Where I Stay

[Bridge: Jayo Felony]
It's A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood
Niggas Get Sprayed Ak And It's Good
Bitches Don't Get Placed Something That's Good
It's Real And It Feels When You're Living In California

[Verse 3: WC]
See It's Just Another Day In My Neighborhood
First Thing Off In The Morning And I'm Looking For That Good
Sticking To My Fingertips And I'm Sitting On The Hills
Overlooking The City Man This Shit Is For Real
When You Yak In My Puff?
Lack In The Fifty Bruff?
Itll Be A long That's What We Got These Bitches For
Bounce Like A Earthquake Let It Shake
Let's Hear How Much Noise The City Makes
See It's Just Another Day In My Neighborhood
And The Police Ain't Fucking With Me Knock On Wood
Or My Shoes Cause He Blew My Socks So Good
Bulit My Shot Never knew Id See My Glock So Good
I'm Walk Like Po Po Wanna Hit
He Just Can't Do But They All Wanna Split
I Try To Keeo My Pedro Head On
See I Tried To Warn Them Fuck Around
You Know What Goes Down In Califonia

Dough We Get That Dough
Ooh We Got To Get More
Living Just Another Day
(Just Another Day)
AK Gun Play
(Ak Gun Play)
LA To The Bay
(LA To The Bay)
Living Life In California

[Verse 4]

Dough We Get That Dough
Ooh We Got To Get More
Living Just Another Day
AK Gun Play
LA To The Bay
Living Life In California
Dough We Get That Dough
Ooh We Got To Get More
