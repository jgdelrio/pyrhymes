Ice Cube Lyrics




"All Day, Every Day"



Gangsta Slow That Shit Down
Yea Who Wanna Ride With This?

We Can Ride All Day EveryDay
It's Do Or Die All Day Everyday
It's Suicide All Day Everyday
You'll Be High All Day Everyday

I'm Rolling Down The Avenue
Doing What I Gotta Do
Sick As The Swine Flu
Ain't Nothing Fine as You
Must I Remind You
What Is Behind You
Drop It Down Took The Ground Like You Was Designed Too
You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It (You Can Do It)
You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It (You Can Do It)
You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It (Slow It Down)
You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It (And all That)

We Can Do It All Day Everyday
Get Into It All Day Everyday
Drinking Fluids All Day Everyday
I Presue It All Day Everyday

You Can Have It Just Reach Out And Grab It (Reach Out And Grab It)
You Can Have It Just Reach Out And Grab It (Reach Out And Grab it)
Just Be Careful Don't Be A Silly Rabbit (Silly Rabbit)
Recreation Use Will Turn Into A Habit (Cut The Shit)

To The Ground Take It To The Ground Girl (Cut The Shit)
To The Ground Take It To The Ground Girl (Cut The Shit)
To The Ground Take It To The Ground Girl (Cut The Shit)

Fuck The FEDS All Day Everyday (Yea Yea)
And Chickenheads All Day Everyday (Yea Yea)
Get Your Bread All Day Everyday (Okay)
Use Your Head All Day Everyday

You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It
You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It (You Can Do It)
You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It
You Can Do It Lil Mama You Can Do It
(Drop That Shit)

All Day Everyday (Certified)
All Day Everyday (Qualified)
All Day Everyday (Westcoast Warlord)
All Day Everyday
(Roll That I Blase That
Nigga Fuck Way Back
I Dos That I Does That
Homie What Was That?)
