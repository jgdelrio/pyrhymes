Ice Cube Lyrics




"Turn Off The Radio"



Turn on the radio take a listen
What you're missing
Personally I'm sick of the ass-kissing
What I'm kicking to you won't get rotation
Nowhere in the nation
Program directors and DJ's ignored me
Cause I simply said fuck Top Forty
And top thirty top twenty and top ten
Until you put more hip-hop in
Then I might grin but don't pretend that you're down with the C
And go and dis me in a magazine
How could you figure the brother could dig ya
DJ face down in the river
No it's not a threat but a promise
I'm as 
Crazy as they come see 
Mama didn't love me
All I got is my nine
And to calm the savage beast here's the Alpine

<Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Turn off that motherfucking radio!
Turn off that bullshit!
Play the music motherfucker put the music on
Damn!>

Tune in to the radio listen for a minute
Yo G stick a fucking tape in it
Cause all the radio do is gangle
That R&B love triangle
If you're out there kicking it with the brothers
You don't care about lovers
You wanna hear a young nigga on the mic
Going buck wild
Throwing and flowing and showing new styles
That's where I'm coming from
Reality that's what they're running from
So if you're down with Ice Cube let me know that you know
Yo turn off the radio

<You know what?  You know what?
Basically those black guys and those rap guys
They don't know what the fuck they're doing
I hate those fuckers
I hate em
Especially that one guy
The AmeriKKKa's most wanted
Ice Cube--I hate that fucker
Get him off the air,  get him off, get him off
Get that rap shit out of here!>
<Just get me a gat so I can smoke this motherfucker!>

The Nigga Ya Love To Hate
AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted
What They Hittin' Foe?
You Can't Fade Me
Once Upon A Time In The Projects
Turn Off The Radio
Tales From The Darkside
A Gangsta's Fairytale
I'm Only Out For One Thang
Get Off My Dick And Tell Yo Bitch To Come Here
Rollin' Wit The Lench Mob
Who's The Mack?
It's A Man's World
The Bomb
