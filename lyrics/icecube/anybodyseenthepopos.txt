Ice Cube Lyrics




"Anybody Seen The PoPos?"



Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let 'em know
When I'm rollin' in the low low
You can't fuck with the smoke bowl

Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let 'em know
When I'm rollin' in the low low
I serve it to 'em slowmo

Comin' from the west side, motherfuckin' alright
Do this shit all night, leave your ass hog-tied
Nigger, this is raw hide, mixed with the dark side
Never will I walk by, punk, I'm the fall guy

Nigger, you a small fry, looking at the hawk I
Make you buck, I don't give a fuck, I
Make you have to duck my motherfuckin' buckshot
Bloody ass, BB's pulled out your buttocks

These niggers want to know my name
They want to know my game, I got plenty of aim
They said, don't fuck with me
'Cuz if he pull them thangs, there goes your brains, now

His girlfriend's Lois Lane and if you fuck with her
You must smoke Cocaine, brother
Why would you fuck with his?
Blow up your kids and smoke your own mother

Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Where they go?

Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
When I'm rollin' in my low low
I serve it to you slowmo

I'ma keep it real, man, fuck how they feel, man
If your feelin' ill, man, go, take a pill
I'ma keep this steel, man, straight at your grill, man
You can tell opra, nigger, you can tell Bill

But Mr. Cosby, this ain't a hobby
Nigger, this the ghetto, just like sowheto
Where niggers want to hurt you, there's no rehearsal
There's no commercial when you're turning purple

These niggers want to know my name
They want to know my game, I got plenty of aim
They said, don't fuck with me
'Cuz if he pull them thangs, there goes your brains, now

His girlfriend's Lois Lane and if you fuck with her
You must smoke Cocaine, brother
Why would you fuck with his?
Blow up your kids and smoke your own mother

Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Where they go?

Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
When I'm rollin' in my low low
I serve it to you slowmo, here they come

That's the sound of the police, police
That's the sound of the police, police
Ain't nuthin' more important to me then payback
I'm holding court in the streets
Ain't nuthin' more important to me then payback
I'm holding court in the streets

Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Where they go?

Anybody seen the popo's?
Anybody seen the popo's? Let me know
When I'm rollin' in my low low
I serve it to you slowmo

These niggers want to know my name
They want to know my game, I got plenty of aim
They said, don't fuck with me
'Cuz if he pull them thangs, there goes your brains, now

His girlfriend's Lois Lane and if you fuck with her
You must smoke Cocaine, brother
Why would you fuck with his?
Blow up your kids and smoke your own mother

I gotta keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta

I gotta keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta

I gotta keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta

I gotta keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta
Keep it gangsta, gangsta
