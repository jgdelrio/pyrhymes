Ice Cube Lyrics




"A Boy Was Conceived (Intro)"



[Keith David]
Only three short years after the 1965 Watts Riots and the death of Malcolm X and of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, A Boy Was Conceived, who's lyrics would change the world

[Mike Epps]
Cube, please stop rapping so we can come out and get some, some more of this action mane
You know when we ain't doin' no movies I'm back out here selling half ounce and quarters of that good weed in that neighborhood
