"No Country For Young Men" lyrics

Ice Cube Lyrics




"No Country For Young Men"



Many Motherfuckers Criticize Pros And How They Play
And Many Motherfuckers Criticize Rappers And What They Say
Even Though They Criticize Secretly They Fantasize
But They Know They'll Never Paid Be To Play

Yea I'm a Kill One Of You Young Punks
With A Old School Flow
Flow Flow

[Verse 1:]
Though I Walk Through The Shadow Of Death
I Gotta Make Sure That My Shoes And My Outfit Fresh
Ya'll Bitches Get Jealous When You See Me Coming
Ya'll Would Too If You See My Woman
Ya'll Know What We Bout To Do what we do
This Shit Here Bout As Sick As The Flu
Drunk Motherfuckers Wanna Vomit On My Shoe
Niggas Can't Have Shit Prolly Cause Of You
Rappers Go To Jail Like Oprah Go To Yale
Steadman policy Don't Ask Don't Tell
Wheres My Waterbees As I Go Get The Mail
Half Black Is The New Black Can't You Tell?
It Was BLue Black Like Wesley Snipes In New Jack
Now You Got To Have A White Mama Just To Do That
Tiger Woods Used To Be A Safe Nigga
Go Ahead Let Your Daughter Have A Date With Him
He'll Make With Her Prolly In A Wifebeater
TIger Bout To Change His Name To Cheater
I Don't Like It When You Call Me Big Poppa
From South Central And I Hate Helicopters
If We At School I'll Break In Your Locker
See Me With A Waterbottle Mixed With sparkle Vodka
Drink Responsibly Or Drink Constantly
Be Who You Wanna Be in This Economy
Drunk As Sean Connery At The Finery
Can't Throw Me Out I'm The Honery
Trust Me I'll Never Be The Nominee
I Don't Kiss Enough Ass I'm Too Honery
Ice Cube Be where the Piranah Be
Swim Upstream Eat all kinda meat
Westcoast Treat It Like Hyenas
Take What You Want From These Lieing Ass Cheaters
Eat The Fuck Out These fake ass zebras
That's How We Act When You Don't Wanna Feed Us
Crazy Motherfucker Since I Was A Fetus
You Might Aswell Join Us You Ain't Gonna Beat Us
Please Believe Us You Can Ask Jesus
I'm be here bout As Long As Regis
Understand I Never Pledge Of Alligiance
It's Like Balla Confusion Might Cause A Contusion boy
See You're Crusing For A Bruising
Fucking With A Pricipal That Don't Like Students
Don't You Know detention Is A Lynching
And If I failed To Mention, I'm spending up My Pension
No No No No

[Verse 2:]
The Reason I hung In
Cause This Right Here Is No Country For Young Men
Sunny You Done Fucked Up The Churches Money
I'm Red Fox And You That Big Dummy
THis Junkyard Was A Empire
Ya'll Let It Get Ran BY Vampires
Most MCs Are God Damn Liars
Like Them fuckin Supervisors Working Up keiser
Bitch I'm Not A Dodger I'm A Laker Punk
Use A Fucking Clipper You Can Call Me Jack The Ripper
Cut You Up By Your Gizzard Then Down By Your Liver
Rooter to The Tooter Gut You Like Flipper
Dipper Ya'll Better Treat Me Like The Skipper
Hair Trigga The Air Nigga
Air Honkey And Air Critter
I Come through And Kill Every Litter
Like That Like That Like That...

No Country For Young Men
No No No No
It's just a ball of Confusion
No Country For Young Men
No No No No
Your World Is Just An Illusion
No Country For Young Men
No No No No
It's a ball of Confusion
No Country For Young Men
No No No No
Your World Is Just An Illusion

[Outro:]
It is what it is mother fucker
No country for young men, only a country for real niggas

For real for real, on some real shit
Let me tell you what's real and what's fake
Look don't let me hurt your feelings

Kings of this shit, let it be known
Shit real niggas do real things, niggas better recognize
That's OG shit, old school
West side rollin.
