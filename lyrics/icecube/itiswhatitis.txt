Ice Cube Lyrics




"It Is What It Is"



[Intro]
Will I ever get it right? Get it right? [2X]
My momma think I'm outta sight, outta sight [2X]
It is what it is, it is, it is [2X]
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]
(Understand me!)
Now homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?
It is what it is, it is, is is
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]

Now will I ever get it right? Get it right?
Even though I'm out at night, livin life
Girl I'm tryin to make this money, I ain't even playin
Course the game I'm in, it ain't even payin
When I'm on the go, on the go
Everybody wanna know, wanna know
Cube where the fuck you goin, each and every day?
I just turn around, and I say

[Chorus]
It is what it is, it is, it is [2X]
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]
Now homey do you dig, do you dig, do you dig?
It is what it is, it is, is is
I do this for my kids, my kids, my kids [2X]

Even though I'm messin up, messin up (you fuckin up)
Feel the devil catchin up, catchin up
I put it in the Lord's hands, he is the man
Please his demands 'fore he turn me into sand (don't do it)
But got to pay the rent, pay the rent
Without the government, government
I do it for the fuck of it, fuck of it [2X]

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Got to get my swagger up [2X]
Please get yo' swagger up
Got to get my swagger up
Better get my swagger up

[Outro]
Check this out homey
This business right here, is personal
I would go around you, over you, under you or THROUGH you
to make sure none of my family suffer
Do you understand me?!

[Chorus]
