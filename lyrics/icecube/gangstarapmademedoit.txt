"Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It"



[Female:]
Maestro!

[Ice Cube:]
Blame me

You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow it's R-A-W, R-A-W

You looking at the grand wizard,
War lord vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up pull off with some bad bitches

And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna

Ain't nothing like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona

I'm Utah I got multiple bitches
It's a new law keep a hold of yo riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it
As soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain
And you a lieutenant

I can say what I wanna say
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle
Just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you

Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva
And I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this ho
If you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, gangsta
And why should I change that
Fuck you all motherfuckers trying to change rap
Say what, say what
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back
Say what, say what

I'm trying to get me a Maybach
How you motherfuckers gonna tell me don't say that?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971

So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy headed ho
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talking 'bout real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain not your back
Use your brain not a gat
It's a party not a jack, for real
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal 
Fuck them, fuck them

And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot vaness and imperial
Look at my life
Ice Cube is a miracle

It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't got to be fake cause he is my homie

If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothing to it
Gangsta rap made me do it

Oh, yeah, and another thing
For all ya niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talking about gangsta rap
Cause 9 times out of 10 you don't know the fuck you're talking about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mine

Ice Cube Lyrics



album: "Raw Footage" (2008)
What Is A Pyroclastic Flow?
I Got My Locs On
It Takes A Nation
Gangsta Rap Made Me Do It
Hood Mentality
Why Me?
Cold Places
Jack N The Box
Do Ya Thang
Thank God(from "xXx: Return of Xander Cage" soundtrack)
Here He Come
Get Money, Spend Money, No Money
Get Used To It
Tomorrow
Stand Tall
Take Me Away
Don't Make Me Hurt Ya Feelings
Crack Baby?
