Rakim Lyrics




"Skit 1"



It feel good, ya knahmean?
To uhh, come back and and get embraced
That's that's like the best part y'know?
Bein bein gone for a while y'know
Walk through the streets
'Yo Ra yo when you comin out, you gotta come out'
this and that
Y'know, so y'know I always want to come back
Had little setbacks, but umm
To comeback and get embraced man, that's the best part
