"Skit 2"



Kind of glad I ain't come out in this y'know the last few years, y'know
But umm right now I think everybody want a change
Back to hip-hop and, knowhatI'msayin rhymes skills and
things of that nature, so timing man, timing is perfect
Plus this is ninety-seven, which is Born God, knahmean?
And I'm back, straight up
