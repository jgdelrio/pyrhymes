"Redemption Interlude" lyrics

Zacari Lyrics




"Redemption Interlude"
(feat. Kendrick Lamar & Hykeem Carter)
(from "Black Panther" soundtrack)



[Zacari]
You love it when I fall on my face
Don't act so surprised when
I'm in, oh, rightful places
Ain't it righteous? Amen (amen)

This time around, there's time to turn it around
This time around, there's still time to turn it around
This time around, there's always time to turn it around
This time around (this time around)

[Hykeem Carter (Kendrick Lamar):]
Sky keep falling down
Falling down (Black Panther)
I keep falling down
Falling down
I keep falling down
Falling down
Sky keep falling down
