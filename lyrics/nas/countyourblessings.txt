"Count Your Blessings" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Count Your Blessings"
(with Damian Marley)



And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force I'm suggesting
You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings

Count your blessings
'Cause yo this year, can't wait 'til he gets here
7/21/09, my first son will shine
And it's amazing
I'm about to be raisin'
Another made man and like his dad they'll praise him

And some will hate him, just 'cause we're buildin' a nation
Like Bob did with Damian
The world will embrace him
Girls'll chase him
Foresee they will not break him
And when I'm not around, you look for God and thank him

And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings

And there'll be no need for tissues
'Cause there'll be no further issues
If you've got someone who miss you
Man, count your blessings

And I've got love and assurance
And I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings

You're wishin' you were sittin' in the top position
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes, you never hurtin'
You knew that you was destined for greatness for certain

But see the over-zealous, they be thirstin', caught up in emotion
You're keepin' your composure like Gershwin
Songs by Earth Wind keep you in the zone, writing verses
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose

We've got pre-school and daycare
We've got pension and welfare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings

I've got joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings

I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through his door
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
So I count my blessings

I think you're lookin' too hard for it
With the double R under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
And count your blessings
Count your blessings

So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means to reach the level I'm on
You should know that there's only one Nas y'all
But count your blessings
Count your blessings

And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force I'm suggesting
You count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings
