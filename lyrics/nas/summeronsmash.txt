"Summer On Smash"
(feat. Miguel & Swizz Beatz)



[Intro: Miguel]
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only, baby let me take pictures

[Nas]
Life is good, life is good

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Cîroc on splash, summer on smash
Top all gone, got the on summer on smash
Tank top on, summer on smash
My neck got a whole lot of glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)
Look at baby girl showing that ass
She let the world know the summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Everybody get the summer on smash
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)

[Verse 1: Nas]
Got the summer on smash, eighteen karats
Little overweight, hit the gym, let's go get the abs in
Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened
I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by
She's fly; black, Asian, Boriqua
Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern
Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening?
Just rolled four with them, bout to smoke again
Rose-gold Rollie, riding the top down
How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht sound?
Send a massive e-mail to the females
Tell 'em where to meet us, give 'em the details

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Cîroc on splash, summer on smash
Top all gone, got the on summer on smash
Tank top on, summer on smash
My neck got a whole lot of glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)
Look at baby girl showing that ass
She let the world know the summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Everybody get the summer on smash
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)

[Verse 2: Nas]
We got the jam here, check it
It's the summertime, women damn near naked
It's single season, they choosing who to mess with
I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps
My people in the streets, I make it feel like it's the beach
My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach
I'm protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech
Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets
And they ain't even out yet, she like Ciroc peach
Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash
And y'all already know who got the summer on smash

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 3: Miguel]
I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh?
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only, baby let me take pictures
Skin, sin; wait do you know whose pool you're in?
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill
Your body is a weapon that you can't conceal
Real, make money when the freaks call
Summer on Mars, it's totally Total Recall
Like
Una vida, she butterfly
Caliente
Mami vente, vente comigo, ayo

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
