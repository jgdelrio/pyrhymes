Nas Lyrics




"The Art of It"
(feat. J. Myers)



Fire spitta, I ain't never met a higher nigga
Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless
Mansion, marble foyer, I can afford a closet in alphabet order
A-Life, Adidas under "A", the "B" for Bottega, British Knights sneaker
My "C's" so ill, that man, I get chills when I look at my Christian Dior's they kill
"D" is for Dries Van Noten, young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doin'
D cups, tequila and blunts, weed, women and liquor
Depending on the day, it's a different mission
They not knowin', they wanna know what he got on
A QB Don, went and got his Pete Rock on
Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up for him
My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him
Speaking of "G", the gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it
.44's never could miss him
Comin' to see us, glad to see you made it home to the hood nigga
We blowin' trees, tell me, don't it feel good nigga?

Man it feels good, it feel good, don't it?
(La, la, la)
Yeah, put that good shit in the air
(La, la, la)
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (My G niggas)
But as long as we here together (My QB niggas)
We gonna put that good shit in the air
(La, la, la)

Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket
Fuck maintaining, that's lame language
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, I duck quick
Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out of a Magnum
And I'm the type who runs to the drama, lookin' for who clappin'
Nike Boot, when I eat 'em he's like food
Pulled out the barrel, four fifths rip through bone marrow
Make his toes spiral the dirt, while his feet kick up rock
He's a sprinter, police a Jenner, lock up niggas for three winters
When I attack, I'm faceless like an iron mask
Then get away quick, traceless, line back, lions path
I breathe deep like lamaze class
Live long, obtain wisdom and die last
Stressed out or in a body bag, I am that
Live long, obtain wisdom and die last

Man it feels good, it feel good, don't it?
(La, la, la)
Yeah, put that good shit in the air
(La, la, la)
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (My G niggas)
But as long as we here together (My QB niggas)
We gonna put that good shit in the air
(La, la, la)

Look, I don't have that much time, candidly I'm in divorce
Rumors, DUI's in and outta court
Different judges, assault charges, hovers on ya boy
Other niggas wives lust to be in covers with ya boy
Y'all don't want no angry Nas on your label
Y'all got plenty checks, CEO man, I'm only 36
But at this point five on the table
I say with all respect my dude, thank you, we had the best times
But I'm about respect, about the talent I possess
Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk and let you go
Could you imagine Nas the exec?
The artist owning masters, controlling your release
Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me
So my product could be a big commodity
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
Cautiously I write this next line honestly, cause I'm a G
It's no beef, I used to be open to making 50 g's
But now I spend that on a dime to make her neck freeze
My larynx will serenade the hood
I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good
TMZ, they hopin' when the marriage end, I'ma turn to Larry Flynt
Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit
Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get
More real nigga shit

Man it feels good, it feel good, don't it? (La, la, la)
Yeah, put that good shit in the air (La, la, la)
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (My G niggas)
But as long as we here together (My QB niggas)
We gonna put that good shit in the air (La, la, la)
