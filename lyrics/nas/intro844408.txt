"Intro" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Intro"



Invasion!

"Watch closely. You are about to experience a 'nigga moment.' Webster defines the 'nigga moment' as a moment when ignorance overwhelms the mind of an otherwise logical Negro man."

"What did you say, bitch nigga?"

"Die, nigga! [*gunshot*]"

"Brothers and sisters using the word nigga..."

"Nigga, nigga, nigga..."

"He's a nigger! He's anigger!"

"I ain't no nigga!"

"What kind of message are you hoping to send with- with that new album?"

"Fuck the niggers! (Oh, my God!)"

"A nigger, look! it's a nigger!"

"How you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?"

"Flatline!"

"There goes the neighborhood!"
