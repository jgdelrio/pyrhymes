"On The Road Again"
(originally by Jack White)



I wouldn't marry a black woman here's the reason why
(Why)
Black women's evil, do things on the sly
(No)
You look for your supper to be good and hot
(Hot)
She never put the neck bone in the pot

She's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(She's on the road again)
She's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)

I went to my window, my window was propped
I went to my door, my door was locked
I stepped right back, I shook my head
A big black nigga's in my folding bed
I shot through the window, I broke the glass
I never seen a little nigga run so fast

He's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)
He's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
God, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)

Your friend at your house just to rest his hat
Next thing he wanna know where your husband's at
She says "I don't know he's on his way to the pen"
Come on mama, let's get on the road again

She's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(She's on the road again)
He's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)

I'm with my black woman let me tell you
(Why)
Black women's evil, do things on the sly
(No)
You look for your supper to be good and hot
(Hot)
She never put the neck bone in the pot

She's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(She's on the road again)
She's on the road again
(Just as sure as you're born)
Lord, a natural-born eastman
(On the road again)

Yeah!
Uh-huh
Yeah
