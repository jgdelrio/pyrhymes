"Queens Wolf"



At 14, tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fightin' Italian rival gangs, they were sniffin' glue
I was skippin' school, smokin' green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody's team jacket, slept through my classes
The borough of Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student had delusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, Werewolf fanatic and Drucul
One night after school when train hoppin' and snatching jewels
I dozed at midnight, I woke up a little after 2
My hands shook violently, my eyes took red
My hair spun in waves, bread was the only word I said
I heard voices and the nights callin'
Them Benz engines roarin'
Heard that gin and champagne pourin' and n****s ballin'
I put the .22 on my waist, the face and the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens Wolf

You can hear me growlin' through public housin'
No tellin', might wake up in Queens House or Rikers Island
A Queens Wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bustin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
They hear me growlin' through public housin'
No tellin', might wake up in Queens House or Rikers Island
A Queens Wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bustin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'

Waking up is a pleasure, though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from? This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? Who laced it?
Previous night memories, who erased 'em? Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, lunar, the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons are talkin' 'bout it
Singing me praises, said I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam, screaming out QB and I'm the loudest
Homey, them dudes is scared, you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team
So that explain the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there the day before, I suppress 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, nigga, my QU shit
Audemar watch, burn a peach Swish, new whip
Stoli vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showin, snarling when the moon's lit

You can hear me growlin' through public housin'
No tellin', might wake up in Queens House or Rikers Island
A Queens Wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bustin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
They hear me growlin' through public housin'
No tellin', might wake up in Queens House or Rikers Island
A Queens Wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try bustin' the silver bullet inside him, they dyin'
