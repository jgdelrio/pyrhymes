"Virgo" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Virgo"
(feat. Ludacris)



One...two...yeah...huh...Nasir

[Chorus - Nas]
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot
You ain't got be my girl though
I'll drop you off at Willoughby and Myrtle [two streets in Brooklyn, N.Y.]
Smash with the Virgo
Ain't got to take your shirt off
But see me convince your homegirl though

[Nas]
Uh, she says some life is too hard
She says that she wanna come build and with the god
Promise me that she gonna play her part
Cause what I spit gets straight to her heart
And she damn fine, feet hammertime
Damn if I mind
Long as the butt bubble in back of your waistline
I don't waste time, I gotta get-get on it
Just you and me, two glasses, sippin' Patron
In the club scene where I met Miss Green Eyes
She walked by asking me "Are you Nas?"
"Why?"
"If you was I'd be totally T.W.I"
"What's that?"
"Totally With It. T.W.I"
"Ha, well here I am"
"Yep, I'm the man"
"Bartender, put a Cosmo in that girl hand"
So here we standin' before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem
Tongue skills, yea I like that
Now we on the right track
Straight to my Phantom called "Africa Black"
Ever since then, she been yappin' her track
Told her friends now they hollerin' behind her back
Sing

[Chorus - Nas]
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot
You ain't got be my girl though
I'll drop you off at Willoughby and Myrtle
Smash with the Virgo
Ain't got to take your shirt off
But see me convince your homegirl though

[Ludacris]
Now I was so fresh and so fly in diamonds
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shining, "bling!"
A little cute thing said, "What's your name?"
I put my necklace in her face and told her "Read the chain"
Ooh, ooh so stuck up
Told me "Shut the fuck up"
Blow! Ludacris is in the hot Luke house
The needle hit the record, they was playing this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh on
Live forever like 'Fame', let the Leroys dance
While I'm laid back chilling in my b-boy stance
Could be a little pop locking if your girl's tops droppin
But watch for cock blockin all my coochie stock options
But later for that ASDAQ throw 'em on the fast track
Make 'em swip-swap Nasty N.A.S pass that
Honey in the black cause I'm feeling her curves
She looked down and what I had is that wa-wa word
Why only serve one when you can serve up two
Then at the bachelor's pad doing what the Virgos do
And these women so shy, but get loud undercover
So we can have sex, but I can't be your lover!
Sing

[Chorus - Ludacris]
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
We sippin' on Merlot
You ain't got be my girl though
I'll drop you off at Peachtree and Merlot
Smash with the Virgo
Ain't got to take your shirt off
But see me convince your homegirl though
