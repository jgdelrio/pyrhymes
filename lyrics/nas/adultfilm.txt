"Adult Film" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Adult Film"
(feat. Swizz Beatz)



RAW
RAW

Fuck outta here, second guessin' our love
Dick Tracy detective inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club
Get a cook book, you gossipin', watchin' Hip-Hop and Love, ugh
I don't mean to be brass, even the genius asks questions in class
Supposed to know a love that'll last
Her friends, they don't mess with rappers, correction
I'm Akhenaten, King Tut's predecessor
I fantasize, no mind him, I'm slick with words
Tell your girlfriend I flip the birds
She don't know shit, I am your neighbor, brother, homie, lover, friend to smoke with
I want us to take road trips, fuck that low shit
I'm on some more ol' 'Everybody should know' shit
Or let's be real discrete, everybody lies, not everybody Nas
So your friend might hate, when was the last time her and her man were straight?
Just chill, lightbulbs dim, you are my endorphin

Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now, life begins right now
No matter what they say
Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now, hey, hey

Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now, life begins right now
No matter what they say
Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now

The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
You start to get comfortable after you get it right, yeah
You start to get comfortable after you get it right

Misogynistic monologue when we dialogue
Yeah, I'm mature from the chest and higher north
But below the waist I'm a dog, your girl in heat like cayenne sauce
She's so sweet, but she kinda lost
Like me, African name, but a diamond cross
When you a strong stand tall soldier, they lean on you, expecting you not to fall over
Like you never feel pressure, like you made of steel
So I absorb your pain, I like to see you chill
Eight millimeter, cinematic celluloid
I see us both, little girl, little boy
Exploring the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors and the shit start weighing on me
Feel your good vibes laying on me, when them lightbulbs dim
Let me watch you, my adult film

Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now, life begins right now
No matter what they say
Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now, hey

Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now, life begins right now
No matter what they say
Life begins right now, life begins right now
Life begins right now, hey, hey
