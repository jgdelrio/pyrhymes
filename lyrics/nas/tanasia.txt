"Tanasia"



Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before
Who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side chick
Go sightseeing with the God, playing cards with my dad
Frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash
Nas, she know who try to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
She's short, he comin' home and she's hyped for his release
Flyer than Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics she ride the wood

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before
Who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before
Who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

She edumacted, she said she related to the Asian ethnic persuasion
The sex is amazing
Never bought her a Birkin, my nighttime nurse may be more like a surgeon
Nice in her eyes, I put that work in
Back when she was on the same block where I was servin'
Set it straight, we need a place up in Jamaica Estates
And she was like, "Oh no" in a silky kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gonna be no husband, I'd be a no show
Leave her standing at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture
Body like she Evil Kenivel on a Soul Cycle
Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael
She knew I wasn't cut from the cloth to be a czar
Now she at the town with the legal Escobar, she's my

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before
Who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before
Who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

We fresh out of the MET Gala, express power
Exude the essence of best dressed for the next hour
Toast glasses, velvet ropes no tresspassin'
Hella smoke, our section has the best fashion
Picture us laughin', how ticklish the money has us
Like little kids but the difference is we'd much rather
Be ghost back in the crib, some avacado toast
Laid back, we choose that over Amalfi Coast
Chillin' startin' to think about children and bringin' them into the world with Kim Jong Il and
But when I'm feelin' what I'm feelin' and she feelin' what she feelin'
I'm willing, she's willing, we buildin'
Every man originated in Asia
One continent, Africa was a part of Asia
Here we are in this Western civilization
I believe that we was destined to make it

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before
Who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before
Who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
