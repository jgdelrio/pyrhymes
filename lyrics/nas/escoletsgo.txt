"Esco Let's Go"



Esco let's go
Esco let's go, c'mon
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
Esco let's go, yeah, c'mon

I used to drive in a circle before I pulled up
Now I just go up, they know when I got it tucked
Tip the door man, racist neighbors flinching
They don't know if I'ma rob 'em or if I'm Russell Simmons
They thought it was me, just like Mike Bivins
They pray for my downfall like the mom of Robin Givens
Watching how you living
I just wanted to roll B-L-U-N-T, and watch B-E-T
Picture Amerie eating Free
I'm trying to write hood movies, like Posse and Five Heartbeats
I'm all inside a dark room
My incense smoke took the form of ghost and it spoke
It said, "Nas, you the best on both coasts, you so big
You should write the word slave
On both sides of ya beards like Prince did
So what's this? Fuck St. Nicholas
You the only ghetto nigga in the hood giving gifts"

WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!

I jump in the shower, it feel like rain
Everybody wanna be king but can't handle the pain
Used to rap now they all wanna sing
Ask Elizabeth Taylor, when did ice turn to bling
She said, "Nas, it 'cause y'all rock tiny diamonds in the biggest chains
You the first nigga in the game that said fuck fame
You the 5th nigga in The Beatles
You the 10th nigga in the Wu-Tang, so nigga let yo' nuts hang"
But they can't handle it, I'm scandalous, I'm trifling
That's why I'm wifing 'em, quick to stick a knife in 'em
Catch me thinking, drinking, hurting my health
These women keep trying to unloosen my belt
Trying to get my wealth
I feel like Jesus with doubting Thomas', broken promises
I wanna walk the golden streets like where my mama is
But if I do what y'all want, I'll get a thousand years

WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!

Staring at the face of my watch
It's like a crystal ball with the ability to make the issue stall
I told my man duck 'cause I know where the missile fall
'Cause the ice is a fortune teller for the rich and small
Went to my man crib who dead and saw his picture fall
I picked it up his voice whispered, "nigga ball"
So I smoke the finest, 85 footer ocean liners
I do it for the have nots of mad spots
That resemble screensavers on your laptops
And niggas can't believe it like seeing that nigga Zab drop
I'll be in Cameroon, bandanas on silk Dior
Sip cream liqueur, green and blue Fila velour suits
Boss move, only thing that I endorse duke
Stash houses, gamble, I don't sweat a loss duke
All true and living, God, we was here first
Parisian linen garb and Kashmir shirts

WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, c'mon
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS!
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go (bra tat ta tat tat tata tat bra tat)
Esco let's go, let's go, let's go
WHAT IT IS! WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! Esco let's go, yeah
WHAT IT IS, NIGGA! WHAT IT IS!
