"Angel Dust" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Angel Dust"



Angels with dirty faces, angels with broken wings
The devil's dust, PCP, invaded blood streams
People lining up to get it, Fantastic knew how to flip it
Illegal substances constructing, but plus addicted
Trust it and respect it, almost got me arrested
All of the time I invested in school is now of question
Child prone to violence like a dog returns to its own father
The fool for chaos, taking what we can salvage
Hustling is an art, I'm just trying to be smart
Strung our bodies out in the park, Shaolin was my heart
We stood for loyalty, all we had was each other's back
My raps were like crystallized powder before crack
Raw, uncut, like what they sold in front of the store front
The sidewalk was my brother's office
We cut our losses, I had choices
I took a pen, became a voice for the voiceless
My people walking in a zombie state
Life is short, even mines at stake

The government says that angel dust can kill you if you take it or it can cause you to kill others

The scourge of angel dust has been linked to psychosis, violence, schizophrenia, and the epidemic runs especially rampant in the Bronx. My administration will hunt down these poison pushers and arrest them one my one until we get directly to the source
