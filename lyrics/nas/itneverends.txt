"It Never Ends" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"It Never Ends"



Buckets like Giligan, still I peep reptilians in the field again
Blending in my quintillion ton brain, got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet, "Back To The Grill Again"
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switched styles
Yet to see any heavy weight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the criz-own
Raw, one-take I don't even need a mix down
Demure not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles who make that hiss sound
Their eyes change colors, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover and I let off a fifth round

I got seven Mac 11's
About eight .38's
Nine .9's
Ten Mac 10's, this shit never ends (Rest in peace to B.I)
This shit never ends (B.I.G. shit)
I got seven Mac 11's
About eight .38's
Nine .9's
Ten Mac 10's, this shit never ends (The worlds gone crazy)
This shit never ends

Stop waitin' for the hood to appreciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
What does he mean? Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He's still as hard as he was when he started out
We count him out, we count him in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house, with my my wins, blessings from my friends
Do they love me for me? Or love me for them?

I got seven Mac 11's
About eight .38's
Nine .9's
Ten Mac 10's, this shit never ends (The world's at war)
This shit never ends (Everybody packin')
I got seven Mac 11's
About eight .38's
Nine .9's
Ten Mac 10's, this shit never ends (It never ends)
This shit never ends (What will it take to end?)

Can't see me movin', I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3-D movie, no needed glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear I got perseverance, it's something they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying
I'd rather put my ears to blaring cops siren
My hair in a hot dryer than hear all that pop soundin'
Fake spittin', pop rhymin', niggas should stop lyin'
Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot, tryin' to change but you not risin'?
When will somebody real tell me not Nas and cars you started drivin'
I been ridin', been made it, you and your pretend stages
I did this since windbreakers
