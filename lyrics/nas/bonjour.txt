"Bonjour" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Bonjour"
(feat. Tony Williams)



[Nas:]
(Bonjour)
I should be more mature, sure, I'm spoiled
Hit up the south of France after tour, bonjour (bonjour)
How many girls pre-bate right before they date
So she can have restraint? She still get slayed (bonjour)
That's ill behavior, want the whip matted
Want her ass the fattest, beat it: Thriller jacket
A street metaphor: if your dog piss on the floor
Put his nose in it, check these niggas from the door

[Tony Williams:]
Oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plenty of bisous
A good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour

[Nas:]
Eat at selective kitchens
Speak on our next intentions
Over-creamy Polenta, it come chef recommended (bonjour)
Come through the side entrance, I arrive, bitches
Crackheads still owe me from '89 fixes (bonjour)
Havin' drinks in Vegas, my business
She didn't see me comin', now she's an eyewitness
Laissez le bon temps rouler
Say ah, so the kids could play

[Tony Williams:]
Oui-oui amour
Plenty of kisses, plenty of bisous
Good day and best wishes
Comment allez-vous?
Bonjour

[Nas:]
Vacay share twisted
Whatever happened missed it
Vacations I didn't like, put myself through a guilt trip (bonjour)
All these beautiful places, but the cities be poor
You wealthy when your kid's upbringing better than yours
All this money we gettin'
Could be gone in a minute if we don't invest it
We long-term affected
Watch who you gettin' pregnant
That's long-term stressin'
I got a mil for every bump on your face
That's what I call a blessin', flexin'

[Tony Williams:]
My head looks straight up
And I'm wonderin', "What did I do?" (bonjour)
She looked at me like, "Damn, did I surprise you?"
Sure enough, as the sky's blue, she turned back around
And walked right down the avenue (bonjour)
She's waitin' for the right cue (bonjour)
I'm waitin' for the right clue (bonjour)

(Oui-oui amour)
She be leavin', still I smell her eau de parfum
She can't run 'cause I got Cinderella's right shoe
And, that right girl, but I'm be seein' right through
Crowd obscurin' my view
There's nothin' left to argue (bonjour)
At least there's not from my view (bonjour)
