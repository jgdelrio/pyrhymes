"Jarreau Of Rap (Skatt Attack)"
(feat. Al Jarreau & Keyon Harrold)



Round, round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round, round a harmony
Round, round, round, round a melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily
Round, round, round, round a melody
Round, round, round, round a harmony
Round, round, round, round a melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily

Everybody's not gon' get you but keep goin'
I be crusin', 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubtin' me , they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily rappin' these fundamentals
I assemble the synthesis, 'cause someone said I been
Unadventurous, I been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger

I could son a rapper, everyone one of you rappers, v√°manos
I be runnin' you rappers, Adios
I don't see none of you rappers, all of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax, get a massage
Al Jarreau on the track, Al Jarreau of rap
Made the Mets hat more famous than Strawberry, I know this already

Here's our symphony
I measure by measure of pleasure, a harmony melody
Here's the memories, I used to play 40th Ave. runnin' every yesterday

Had a lot of losses, it hurt a lot losing cash
But it was worth it, I gave a lot, giving back still
I catch heat 'cause I'm black and I'm ill
And I'm real and make millions and they in they feelings
They can't hide it, I don't internalise it, I ignore it
I was taught, to observe it, not absorb it
So I don't absorb it

Melody, married to harmony, one and the same

Taking over all my reveries stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all my reveries stumbling, stumbling, tumbling, fumbling

Evolution of a man and his music
The ill-feel-aholics and chronic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said that I'm multimedia
When you rock O2 Arena you made it
Then it's crazy there, now you gotta rock stadiums
I play at some, when you tuck away or play the cut
Then they front, then the shade comes
They try to say that your day is done

Melody, married to harmony, one in the same
...
