"War Against Love" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"War Against Love"



(What's up African?)
What's up African?

Yo to Haiti, Barbados, Bahamas, Grenada
The wars against love, we under attack
Paris, PR, St. Thomas, DR
The wars against love, who's bussin' back?
From New York to Botswana, London to Guyana
To every single African that's on the map
Yo to Mexico to Cuba, Iceland to Bermuda
The wars against love, we under attack

Scientists told us how the Mayans lived
Highways and landing strips for planes to land
Before the Wright Brothers' plan, aerodynamics
Now I'm chillin' twenty karats like a savage, not embarrassed
Buy what I'm coppin' while I'm shoppin' out in Paris
Parasites try to steal the culture
While chemtrails and satellites hover over
Feds is watchin' real niggas, ask Sister Souljah
Still the 5th is loaded
For these lawyers who be rippin' soldiers off in court
They don't get 'em off
They just take your money and lie
Have you sittin' up north (Foul)
Study the law (Word), get your appeal (True)
Soon you back on the street, the shit'll get real (Facts)
They tried to kill us off since the days of the brilliant Moors
Made they ships, pulled up to the Sicilian shores
So I hustle more, ain't no justice for the poor
Got me feelin' like, middle fingers up, fuck the law
Bust the Dutchie open, liquor pour

Chicago yo, you know Chicago, ya'll know
The war is against love, we under attack (Yeah)
New Orleans, New Orleans to Queens
Yo, the war is against love, who's bussin' back? (Me)
To Detroit (Yeah) St. Louis (Yeah, yeah)
To every hood and all the fifty states on the map (Map)
Chocolate City, North and South Philly (Philly)
Feel me, the war is against love, we under attack

I went from, semi bummy nigga to money nigga
Bike nigga to car nigga
Christ nigga to Allah nigga, then I evolved nigga (Yeah)
No religions, my commandments are my standards (Word)
A stand up man, no clout and no snitchin'
Got a bid I'm sittin' down, do the time
Call it "Paying taxes"
Living with my actions, coroners to the grave
Yeah I'm on that wave
Yeah I fornicate with fly bitches, horny ways
Just the way I was taught though
Can't tell if this is reality or just another award show
These women be lost, so beautiful so smart
But why can't we be Heavenly?
Don't think use your heart (Whole heart)
'Cause we can be so great, great is not too late
Put pride aside, coincide, I bet we both straight
Straight to the top, side to side, twin Rolls Royces
We made choices to be devoted
To go with those foes who come at us with upside down crosses

The war is against love I ain't trustin' that (Trustin' that)
Yo, the war is against love, who's bussin' back? (Me, yeah, me, uh)
To all the fifty states all across the map (The whole world to)
USA and beyond, the wars against love how would you react, to that?
Tell you how I'm reactin', strapped and ready, go all the way
The wars against peace, the wars against love
