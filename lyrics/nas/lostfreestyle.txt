"Lost Freestyle" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Lost Freestyle"



Can't lose me
Who be the holy prophet they watchin' with all this posture
His Rothstein goggle game be the dopest, he gotta be from the 80's era
His tinted shade Carrera, Queens forever, green pipe seats, clean Panamera
Amateur Hanna-Barbera characters, know they envy
The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis
You pick of the week, voted in rappers, you go against me
You can't tantalize a call-girl with just a roll of pennies
Can't bait a lion in your trap without a tranquilizer
You entering a boxing ring with no trainer beside ya
My Panerai watch glows like Avatar, caviar, black diamonds
Can you imagine y'all taking from a rich man' plate?
Kick in his door, 'cause it's war with the blood-suckers of the poor
The first should be last, that's just universal law
Pop the cork, the Perrier-Jouet pours, like this

I tell a story of a prince' life in all his glory
It's 'Killin' Me Softly,' it's sovereign like the buildings in Fort Greene
Hood monsters and niggas who walk mean
Hood niggas and they just came home and they grip they chrome
Can you hear me? Is this thing on?
Test one, two, give me some feedback if y'all can feel it
For the home invasion dudes that be robbin' dealers
Picture me runnin' inside they crib, rollin' with ya
Mask on the face, tyin' up his sister, lookin' for the bricks to get richer
Smackin' up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds
A dirty game when you servin' 'caine
Got feds to watch, hoes to watch, checkpoints and road blocks
Police barricades, batter'-rams, doors off the hinges, wake up flinching
Who ratted man? Knew who it had to been, states, feds and housing added in
Every department searching your apartment
Ram shacking it, found four ratchets, DEA jackets, we gotta escape the madness
(Haha, yeah, escape the madness, yeah)

Through the eyes of Pablo, that's how I'm lookin' at you
There's an obstacle in everything, it's all natural, I'm keepin' it pilin'
Keepin' heat with the silencers
Learnin' Greek and Italian, speak with kings while dining
Good with hyenas, meanin' it's hood when it's time for riding
Ties with suppliers from my days of the projects
Where I resided, a phenomenon
With the 'Amitionz of a Ridah', pretty Amazon on my arm
Nigga, I'm the flyest, the flyest (Haha, yeah, let me hear that)
