"Royalty" lyrics

Nas Lyrics




"Royalty"
(feat. RaVaughn)



Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs
Put a crown on your head and remove the chain
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't set foot in no penitentiary
Oh, don't taste the poison
No, don't you bail on your family
No, no, no, no, no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gonna know when they see us

A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy, that bugs me
Behind her best friends back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less than a week ago, he's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speaker phone
Right before he cleaned up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You could stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk, never swung on nobody
Never let a gun spark
Big '97 Benz with the old body, pulls up to the corner, out jumps his whole body

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs
Put a crown on your head and remove the chain
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't set foot in no penitentiary
Oh, don't taste the poison
No, don't you bail on your family
No, no, no, no, no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (Nigga)
But they gonna know when they see us

Yo, football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives, they lookin for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a Joanne Chesimard to turn to Assata
Spot a king of diamonds, onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick, out of her mans pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I'm thinkin' 'bout settling down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss, the best shit
Take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs
Put a crown on your head and remove the chain
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in a penitentiary
Oh, don't taste the poison
No, don't you bail on your family
No, no, no, no, no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gonna know when they see us

Tryna get my niggas legitimate, shit is ugly
My dude's strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk, liquor bit, young black militant, just hopin' I hit a lick
A criminal's wit, intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Brainy kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass, I'ma star in a movie
Lookin' for my supportin' cast, read the Forbes pages
Lookin' at G4's, wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed and count paper, I'm about paper and pussy
And buyin' the bar, fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead
Young queen, cross your legs
Put a crown on your head and remove the chain
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't set foot in no penitentiary
Oh, don't taste the poison
No, don't you bail on your family
No, no, no, no, no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gonna know when they see us
